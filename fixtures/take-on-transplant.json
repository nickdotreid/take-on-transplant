I think the most difficult part is that these tests are pretty much miserable and if you&#39;re looking at getting a transplant you&#39;re pretty unhealthy therefore it makes it very difficult to get through these tests. It&#39;s one of those situations where you have to be sick enough to qualify but just healthy enough to make it through the surgery. That&#39;s honestly not a great place to be.

I do recall being able to do most of my testing in my local hometown before having to travel to Seattle. I also had to sign a series of consent forms allowing the transplant center to review all of my medical charts, such as ophthalmologist, dermatologist, dental records, yearly gynecologist visits, primary care physician (in home town), cystic fibrosis doctor visits and hospitalizations. I also had to have a renal screening with 24-hour urine collection, dexa scans (for bone density), EKG and ECHO to look at my heart, an esophagram, multiple Computed Tomography or CT scans (of the chest, abdomen and sinuses). You have to be up to date on your vaccines: flu shot, hepatitis B, tuberculosis and tetanus shot. I also had to travel to the transplant center for more testing, such as 24-hour pH monitor (acid reflux testing), more chest x-rays, numerous blood tests, six minute walk test (how far can you walk with or without oxygen), transplant classes, social worker interviews, a visit with the transplant pulmonologist followed by a visit/interview with the transplant surgeon. I believe all of these tests are considered &quot;brutal&quot; because as a CF patient we aren&#39;t in the best of health. Our lungs are failing and it takes all of our energy just to breathe. Also some of the tests require you to lay down in different positions and having &quot;crappy&quot; lungs and being short of breath with the simplest tasks can be very exhausting. Once you are listed for transplant, you have clinic visits every 3-4 weeks with repeat testing as well. The sicker you are the higher up on the transplant list you will go. Just being able to arrive for your appointment is brutal in itself. It is a long and hard process to complete. But once you have your transplant you get your life back! For me some of the small tasks like blowing out a birthday candle is a memory you will never forget or being able to take a walk without coughing is one of life&#39;s simplest treasures!</span></p>",

The goals of this &ldquo;evaluation&rdquo; are to: (1) Better determine how much you can benefit from transplant; (2) Identify conditions that could be optimized to improve your chance of success with transplant; (3) Identify conditions that could make transplant too risky (contraindications). Specific steps vary based on your age, medical history, how sick you are, the transplant program, and other factors. Some parts you may have already completed during your routine CF care and the transplant team will need to gather records. Some can be done in your hometown, but others may need to be done at the transplant center. <a href=\"/resources/12#article-14\">Common steps for people with CF are listed in the table in the resource library</a> and are mentioned in the other responses. I agree with Bill and I always tell my patients that the 24-hour pH probe (to evaluate for acid reflux) and the right heart catheterization (to check the blood pressure in your heart) are the hardest tests to go through. I also remind my patients to just do their best - we know the evaluation is hard and you will have many appointments (sometimes scheduled back to back). Don&rsquo;t get discouraged if something has to be rescheduled. Remember to eat despite the busy schedule. Expect to wait sometimes. Remember we are all on the same team, trying to get you safely to and through transplant!&nbsp; </span></p>",

One day, I just didn&#39;t feel right - I was having a difficult time breathing and was very short of breath. I was very scared! I remember going into my local ER and then being transferred to my local CF center. I remember arriving at the hospital and that is about it. I spent the next month on the ventilator. Both my lungs contracted pneumonia followed by sepsis. I tried coming off the ventilator several times but collapsed shortly after. I do remember being woken up to walk daily while on the vent to try and help with muscle strength. Almost thirty days later I was able to come off the vent with the help of supplemental oxygen. I required 33 liters in the beginning but through PT and hard work I was able to drop to 6 liters of oxygen. I remember my CF doctor walking into my room the day I was discharged saying &quot;It is a race against time now, do you want to live or let the clock run out?&quot; I decided I wasn&#39;t done living this crazy life. Shortly after being discharged I was referred to the transplant center in July 2014. After months of testing and long conversations I was listed in September 2014. </span></p>",

And in the final two years, there was just no way to fight the decline. I had switched CF doctors/hospitals and I knew something was wrong but the new doctors weren&#39;t mentioning transplant just kind of giving me the run around of what could be wrong, what I needed to be doing better, etc. Until I went on a trip to Vegas with friends and woke up the second day just completely void of any sort of energy or ability to do anything remotely strenuous. The last 3 days there I could barely get out of bed to use the bathroom because I would be winded immediately after sitting up. When I got back home my mom took me to the ER and the ER doc told me straight up that I was dying. I was sent home on oxygen and plans to get an electric wheelchair and the fight for new lungs began.</span></p>",

Also, during clinic visits you are required to do a six minute walk test. You have to walk as far as you can without any supplemental oxygen and then they measure the distance you can walk and how much oxygen you require. I do not live in Washington so I scheduled all my testing to be done within a week. It was a very long and tiring week. Schedule your tests to what best suits you!</span></p>",

In most cases, inhaled medications may be used for a short while after transplant but are not long-term medications anymore. It is VERY important to take the immunosuppression medications every day. We measure blood levels for some of the immunosuppression medications (e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine) and these levels need to be drawn at a set time interval after your last dose of the medication. The goal of these medications is to prevent rejection of the lungs. There are some other important medicines - antibiotics and/or antivirals to prevent infections because your immune system is weakened, insulin to treat diabetes if it develops, and sometimes azithromycin to prevent a chronic form of rejection. Most of my patients tell me the medications are much easier (and faster!) after transplant compared to the CF routine.</span></p>",

And there are times when I can say yes genuinely and without hesitation. Some of the aftermath has been a lot to deal with, having to create an entirely new normal, relearn things, learn to breathe for the first time. Consider EVERYTHING as you answer this question for yourself. Don&#39;t only consider that &quot;anything is better than this.&quot; If you only consider that, the low moments may hit you like a ton of bricks.

        "content": "<p>I was diagnosed with CF at the age of 13 and my first <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/exacerbation\" target=\"_parent\">exacerbation</a> and hospitalization came when I was 14. At that time, I was told that my life expectancy would be until about 40-45 years old and knowing that at such a young age had a profound influence on the life decisions that I made going forward. I was the first person in my entire family history to have CF, so it was a big adjustment, but it finally explained why I was always so sick growing up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was very important for me to live life to the absolute fullest and not be defined by CF. When I became pregnant before I was slated to go to college, and was told, &ldquo;now or never&rdquo; by the doctors, I decided to have a child. And she was the best thing that happened to me! I also decided that one day, I would go back to college and get my degree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a full life of working in the corporate sector (until the stress made my health worse and I had to go on <a href=\"/resources/diability\">disability</a>), getting my college degree, starting a business with my husband, being a PTA mom, avid dog rescuer and gardener, and doing as many DIY house projects as I could. My way of staying involved with the CF community was to participate in all research/drug trials that I could since being diagnosed. I also knew that I wanted to donate my old lungs to science someday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was holding steady with my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/fev1\">FEV1</a> in the upper 30&rsquo;s for quite some time and was quite active. I knew over the years that I was in a slow decline and that eventually my story would come to end. For some reason, I did not think transplant was an option for me and that transplant was reserved for only the super sick and other folks who were worse than I was (denial maybe?). Stress has always played a role in my CF journey; however, I knew it was really taking a toll on my body, when I had to become my husband&rsquo;s caregiver when&nbsp;he suffered a brain injury and needed more care than I did. I started needing more and more IV <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/antibiotics\">antibiotic </a>treatments at home- it used to be every 3-4 months and then it gradually became every month. Then before transplant, within two days of coming off of IV&rsquo;s I would start to decline again &ndash; so I knew that I was getting worse and worse. The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; daily struggle to breathe got worse, the amounts of meds/treatments needed increased. The frequency of coughing that caused me to pull rib muscles intensified. I was so exhausted each day from running it all (business, house, hubby, pets) and treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I finally had that conversation with my doctor about lung transplant, I was already in the hospital with an exacerbation and it came as a big shock!&nbsp; I knew it was coming, but it was like a light bulb moment when it finally dawned on me that I had become one of those super sick folks. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/survival-statistics\">transplant had vastly improved</a> over all the years and it was the only way for my story to continue.&nbsp; My daughter was visiting me when the doctor came in and we had a candid conversation together about transplant. We cried and I really freaked out of course (I mean who wouldn&rsquo;t?).&nbsp; After I had a chance to process, my next reaction was to find out anything and everything I could about lung transplant, the <a href=\"/resources/evaluation\">protocols</a>, and what to expect &ndash; I was really anxious to get this ball rolling!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the protocols and getting put on the list, the doctors wanted me to lose weight (about 50 pounds) before the surgery (and as soon as possible) because it was a race against time. Unfortunately, I was then diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer, and I had to wait for two years after my biopsy surgery due to the rules about cancer at my transplant center. I was started on <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/supplemental-oxygen\">oxygen </a>shortly afterwards and experienced life with various oxygen tanks (from the shoulder version to the little cart), home condenser, emergency backup tank, and travel pack. It was a very, very stressful time, as you can imagine.&nbsp; I had a 50-foot oxygen tube in the house with my concentrator and it became a joke in my house. We were calling it my tail, and that&rsquo;s how people would find me, by following the tubing. Eventually, I would have to take showers with my oxygen on, no lights, windows open. The house had to be kept on the cool side because any amount of heat was too much for me to breathe.&nbsp; During that waiting process, I developed <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/hypercapnia\">hypercapnia </a>because my body was working so hard to stay alive &ndash; I started on <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/bipap\">Bi-PAP</a> at night and then was encouraged to spend as much time on it during the day that I could. It was my lifeline and I knew it was helping me stay alive. Waiting was the hardest part mentally and emotionally, because when you get that close to transplant, it&rsquo;s a daily struggle to stay alive. I felt a little part of me dying each day and not knowing if I would stay alive long enough for transplant or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I dived into anything I could about the process, what to expect, etc. I watched surgery videos of the clam shell technique and watched the YouTube video of a woman who had CF, breathing for the first time after her lung transplant surgery and the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/extubated\">tube</a> being taken out &ndash; I dreamed about having that same moment! It kept me going and I made a long list of all the things I wanted to do again or try to do after transplant &ndash; I called it my dream&nbsp;list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was told about a Facebook support group, and it was a huge mix of people, of all different lung issues that warranted transplant, as well as a mix of family/friends and pre/post-transplant patients. I asked a ton of questions, read every post that I could, and really got a lot out of participating &ndash; it was amazing and truly needed. I was interested in knowing tips and tricks for before and after surgery, what to expect. What <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/immune-suppression\">medications</a> I might take, what to pack or not to pack in the &ldquo;go bag&rdquo;, which type of insurance was needed to get medications, how other people modified their houses, what supplies people had or wished that they had on hand to make their lives easier. I was able to find out quite a bit about those things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I received so much encouragement and love and support from a group of strangers, who felt like family, because no matter what health issue someone had, we were all going through the journey together. I was very lucky to have my therapist to talk to once a week, and sometimes even twice per week. I had her the entire time, since the beginning. I highly recommend getting someone to talk to, because if you didn&rsquo;t have anxiety and depression before, you will (which is totally normal and happens to us all). I had a doctor tell me, if you didn&rsquo;t by this point in the process &ndash; they&rsquo;d be worried that something was wrong with you. That doctor probably has no idea how much that helped me that day, but it was everything.</p>",

        "title": "The Call, The Transplant, & The Recovery",
        "content": "<p>From the time I was listed to when I got the&nbsp;<a href=\"/resources/call\">call</a> was so fast (a little over 30 days). I really thought I&rsquo;d have more time to get things in order. &nbsp;When I met with the surgeon, he mentioned a time frame for when he thought I would be getting surgery (around six months). I honestly was not sure I&rsquo;d be able to stay alive that long, because I&rsquo;d already been waiting two years at this point. But I was going to continue to give it everything that I had, and as a bonus I lost about 55 pounds along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I got the call, I was already admitted to the hospital directly from a clinic visit, because I was so sick. I had to do the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/6mwt\">six-minute walk test</a>&nbsp;and almost passed out within the first minute, which really scared me. I broke down emotionally when I thought about how I was physically going to get back to my car in valet parking, in order to go home, because I knew I couldn&rsquo;t walk there. I did not have the energy or the strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My nurse got the call for me (on my sixth day of being in the hospital) as she was in the process of <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/gowning-up\">gowning up</a>&nbsp;before she could enter my room. I heard her chat with someone and then she said to me that I was going to want to talk to this person (I was totally confused at this point). She was trying to keep her emotions in check. When you hear the words, &ldquo;we have donor lungs&nbsp;for you&rdquo;, you will never forget that moment! I was ecstatically happy, stunned, and shaking with excitement, and then burst into tears of joy. My nurse and I had the best moment together and we hugged and cried. Then fear of surgery/surviving/recovery starts to kick in, because you hope that it&rsquo;s not a dry run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was celebration that night. My family/friends came, I ate a bunch of sushi and then later when everyone left and it was just my daughter and myself. My fear started to kick in; however, I had work to wrap up &ndash; so we were both up until 4am doing that.&nbsp; We were having conversations about what to do if I didn&rsquo;t make it, and I was also way too excited to sleep with thoughts of: I&rsquo;m going to live and breathe again! I knew I was in really good hands and in the right place to have this life saving surgery, even though my donor lungs were higher than standard risk and going into surgery I had trepidations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a difficult surgery, with a lot of complications during and after. It was clear at the surgery how weak I had become. I was <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/intubated\">intubated </a>and not awake for almost a week. My chest&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t closed&nbsp;after the first surgery, so I had another surgery to close me back up and I needed multiple blood transfusions. The <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/icu\">ICU&nbsp;</a>nurses said that I had set a record for the number of IV&rsquo;s after surgery and I was like an octopus with eight <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/chest-tubes\">tubes</a>. Then, a week or two after surgery, I ended up having heart problems, so they had to shock&nbsp;me. That was scary and weird, especially because I&rsquo;ve seen too many medical shows on TV. I was in the hospital for almost a month. I was mumbling, not talking. I had a terrible time swallowing, and eating was really hard for me afterwards. I was so weak in the beginning that I couldn&rsquo;t hold my cellphone or figure out how to use it. Ordering food was challenging because concentrating on the menu and picking up the phone was too much. I developed massive stomach problems after surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was told I was going to have a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/bronchoscopy\">bronchoscopy&nbsp;</a>if my chest PT wasn&rsquo;t doing the trick (I felt like I failed), and I had no idea what a bronchoscopy entailed. I asked, and finally the doctor came in and chatted with me and explained what they do.&nbsp;If they would have told me before, it would have been fine and would have lowered my anxiety. It was a breeze, and I would do it again!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of things I wish I had known more about. I wish I had learned about additional home health resources that are available out there for my particular home situation. My home situation and family weren&rsquo;t ready when I was discharged and being discharged wasn&rsquo;t a pleasant experience. One of my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/caregiver\">caregivers&nbsp;</a>got injured, and I thought about hiring a nurse (and should have). We were all so stressed that it caused quite a bit of family drama that could&rsquo;ve been avoided. I would have benefitted from more information about average lengths of recovery, and just how truly hard recovery was going to be. How long my routines would take in comparison to when I was pre-transplant dealing with CF. Not to mention the pain&nbsp;I&rsquo;d be in, along with the anxiety of worrying about everything else &ndash; woo, I was a hot mess!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also would have liked to hear about things that are common after surgery, that other patients have experienced, so I didn&rsquo;t feel so alone in dealing with weird things that happened to my body. For example, some of my hair falling out, my skin literally shed from head to toe (I felt like I was a snake). Things like how <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/tacrolimus\">tacrolimus</a> can give you a tremor or change your taste buds and other little things. I used to love chocolate, but now I don&rsquo;t really care for it; along with not being able to stand spicy food when I used to love it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recovery took a while, but I became stronger and got better and better once I was home and able to really sleep. I&rsquo;ve been incredibly lucky that my lungs have had no problems whatsoever and that my heart recovered. I&rsquo;m so grateful that I&rsquo;m not struggling to breathe anymore and that my story gets to continue! I can just feel things here and there. The tight rubber band feeling around my chest that&rsquo;s there, the feeling of am I really breathing because the lungs feel a little disconnected from my body, the sensitivity around my chest hasn&rsquo;t gone away but the soreness has gone down quite a bit with my sternum. So, I&rsquo;m hoping that more time will allow the nerves to regrow and that sneezing, yawning or hiccups will feel less awful over time. But now my body actually gets tired before my lungs do!</p>",

As traumatic as it was, you find out who your real friends are and what your family is made of, and who can&rsquo;t handle it. That&rsquo;s totally the beautiful part of life. The doctors, nurses and my donor saved my life and for that I will be eternally grateful and can never thank everyone enough! I&rsquo;ve been working through my dream list and checking off things and overjoyed that <a href=\"/resources/health-related-quality-of-life\">I can do all of them!</a> From little things, like walking my dog through the park, going to a huge dog park, seeing the seasons change, yoga, gardening, house improvement projects, continuing to care for my husband, and most importantly watching my daughter fall more in love and knowing that I&rsquo;ll be alive/able to see her get married and possibly have children. I have a second chance at life - quite literally, and the immense joy and happiness that come with that and being able to breathe without any more struggle - that privilege is worth the minute problems that I&rsquo;m left with from the surgery. I remember telling my dentist, that I was going to wait to fix my smile and get braces if I survived transplant, and now I am almost done with the braces! I am now able to plan a vacation, go on long car rides, garden, go hiking, fishing and camping. I haven&rsquo;t been able to breathe this well since I was a teenager!</p>",

        "content": "<p>My story is a bit unique because my spouse wasn&rsquo;t able to help out as he would have wanted, and my main caretaker got injured, so I needed more help than I had. However, this process has given me a different perspective on life than I had before transplant. The process makes you cherish all the moments you have left and dream about all the things you could possibly still do. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s definitely a wild ride and not for the faint of heart. No one can truly prepare for this because we are all so different and our body/lungs are all so different. There can be problems that are way worse than mine, and conversely some people just breeze through. Now after having survived the ordeal, I feel compelled to help others along this journey as much as I can. And I hope to one day discover my donor&rsquo;s story, as we are now connected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laugh, stay positive and dream as often and as much as you can. It will help you keep your sanity and it helps to keep hope alive, because this process is scary. Be active as much as you&rsquo;re physically able, because you need to be the strongest you can be before surgery. You want to make sure you get as prepared as you can during the waiting process - knowing you won&rsquo;t be able to do much for a few months. Going to the bathroom by yourself is like a major victory when recovering or taking a hot shower by yourself and being able to stand/breathe easy on your own &ndash; you&rsquo;ll feel like you won the lottery! Prepare the family, it can be overwhelming for them, so make sure that they have support as well. You can prepare your family for everything, but then when it happens to you, their loved one, and they see the aftermath, then that&rsquo;s a different thing and a new reality.&nbsp;My family took photos of me post-surgery because they didn&rsquo;t know if I was going to make it or not, and if I did, they knew I&rsquo;d eventually want to see them. I wish I would&rsquo;ve meal prepped better than I had, but luckily my tribe of family/friends&nbsp;helped tremendously and people would cook and grocery shop for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel strongly about letting your family and friends know how much you truly care about them. Never take anything for granted and be kind to the doctors and nurses &ndash; they deserve it! Lastly, be kind, patient and forgiving of yourself during the waiting and healing process and if you need a lot of naps &ndash; do it.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I was&nbsp;working, and I was getting infections I couldn&rsquo;t kick, especially with smoke from wildfires. In&nbsp;September 2018 I went into <a href=\"/resources/respiratory-failure\">respiratory failure</a>. I basically had a heart attack due to respiratory distress and was brought back to life with CPR and adrenaline. The hospital told my wife I had less than a 10% chance of living. When I came to and was conscious, the staff was completely shocked that I had lived in our city for 20 years, was 40 years old, and that they had never met me as a CF patient.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t stable at that point though. They couldn&rsquo;t <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/extubated\">extubate</a> me and decided to keep me on a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/ventilator\">ventilator</a>, thinking my lungs could improve with treatment and time. I had to have a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/trach\">trach</a> and a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/feeding-tube\">feeding tube</a>&nbsp;to improve my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/bmi\">weight</a>&nbsp;because my BMI (body mass index) got very low. I never completely recovered and I was in and out of the hospital. My infections were just too bad and none of the antibiotics seemed to be keeping them back. By May 2019 my doctor said, &quot;I just don&rsquo;t think we are going to be able to make these lungs work, we need to start talking about a lung transplant.&quot; I was living on a ventilator and <a href=\"http://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/low-oxygen\">oxygen</a>. The pressure was on to decide and get the ball rolling about transplant. I began to realize what life would look like either way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I traveled to the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/transplant-center\">transplant center</a> and the doctor told me about what to expect. I needed to gain more weight because my BMI was too low to qualify for transplant.&nbsp;I learned that <a href=\"http://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/survival-statistics\">survival estimates</a>&nbsp;after&nbsp;transplant were about ten years. It sounded like anything could happen, but also that I could have a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/health-related-quality-of-life\">normal life</a>, breathing better than before. I said, well okay that&rsquo;s what I need to hear. I don&rsquo;t want to just suffer through. I don&rsquo;t want to go through this torment of a lung transplant, and then just be miserable or in bad shape still. I felt more confident about the work up, although the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/antibiotics\">antibiotics </a>still weren&rsquo;t working and I seemed <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/drug-resistant\">drug resistant</a> to anything they could throw at me. Nothing was working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was in pretty bad shape. I went to a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/long-term-respiratory-care-facility\">long-term respiratory care facility</a> to try to get stronger. Those guys did a good job with <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/pulmonary-rehabilitation\">physical therapy</a> and <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/antibiotics\">antibiotics </a>that helped a bit. Then I went to the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/transplant-center\">transplant center</a> to get my <a href=\"/resources/evaluation\">work up</a>. I made it through 2 days worth of <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/tests\">tests </a>but then had to be checked into the hospital.&nbsp;After we finally got to check out of the hospital, I was listed for lungs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to be aware of what was going on. People had to be paying attention to me. I didn&rsquo;t talk because I was on the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/ventilator\">ventilator</a>. I was always texting. I would have to talk through my wife because she could read lips. That&rsquo;s another thing that was emotional too, being on a ventilator, you can&rsquo;t talk. Being a social person, it was really emotional to have a lot of people visiting, checking in on me, and seeing how I&rsquo;m doing. I loved it, but it was really hard not being able to communicate well.</p>",

My weight stayed up more easily on Trikafta. On the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/ventilator\">vent</a>, I suctioned a pint and a half of mucus per day because you can&rsquo;t cough it out. When I got on Trikafta I barely produced a half an inch of mucus a day. And then I tried one of my normal antibiotics and it worked on my infection. I thought, boy if I stay on this I&rsquo;ll get lung function back. But I talked to my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/pulmonologist\">pulmonologist</a> at home and she said she didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being at home and on Trikafta I was able to do stuff and enjoy my family,&nbsp;have a pretty good time, and just be hopeful about lungs. I had started to get down about things, about not having a normal life. Then, I started to see that my normal was going to be different. Trikafta helped me with going through the process of waiting. I&rsquo;m very grateful. It gave me peace, too. It took a lot of stress off my body, I overall felt better in many ways. Even my temperature control got back to normal, more normal, I should say. Being on a ventilator, your temperature gets a little out of whack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that if Trikafta had been available to me in July or sooner of 2018, I would not have had my heart attack in September. I really, honestly believe that. I think between Trikafta and the extra <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/physical-therapy\">physical therapy</a> that I got, I got strong enough to go through a surgery. I really do. I was trying to do physical therapy, but Trikafta gave me the chance to do it better, and push myself a little harder. I definitely was that kind of person, I like to push myself. I was trying to push myself, and I couldn&rsquo;t go that long, I would drop down in <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/oxygen-saturation\">oxygen saturation</a>. After the Trikafta, I felt much stronger and able to go longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think what I would say to someone who wants to be on Trikafta is that first of all if you are really sick and need a lung transplant, it is probably only going to help you be strong enough to get through the surgery. It will make you feel more comfortable. I think it is great to be excited to try it, and maybe your <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/lung-function\">lung capacity</a> is enough to where it can extend things before you need to have a transplant. But your team should agree that your number is high enough to wait for transplant. There&rsquo;s definitely a balance there with waiting and getting stronger either for transplant or generally. I don&rsquo;t think it hurts to be on Trikafta at all, although it is sad how expensive it is.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The first phone <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/call\">call</a> I got saying they had lungs for me was around 2pm in the afternoon. They said you need to get here by 8pm. We live two and a half hours away from the transplant center.&nbsp; It was winter time and we knew driving was going to be a little slow. But we made it there, we checked in, I got up the next morning and went into surgery. I was ready. I was knocked out, and then I woke up and they said to me, &quot;you don&rsquo;t have new lungs.&quot; It was a trial run, or a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/dry-run\">dry run</a>. We were told it can happen even multiple times, but it was disappointing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we were headed home from the transplant center, it was snowing, and a truck went over and blocked all lanes of traffic. I was on battery power on the ventilator and it started overheating. That&rsquo;s how I breathe, and my wife and I started panicking&mdash;what do we do? She had to climb out of her seat and jump in back, get the back-up ventilator and get it going. We were worried about how we could handle things. We had battery power to go for several hours and luckily the lane cleared and we got to drive home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wound up calling the transplant center to check in because I didn&rsquo;t feel well when I got home. I was struggling with the anesthesia effects for a week. They said they&rsquo;d get back to us. We were celebrating my youngest daughter&rsquo;s 14th birthday and my dad was around because he was one of the people who helped me. My wife answered a call, thinking it was just the team getting back to us on how I was feeling, but instead heard that there were two possible sets of lungs and again we should arrive by 8pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have a ventilator and are packing in winter, there is a lot to do to get ready. The passes (roads) were worse than last time and after the issue we had with the ventilator, we needed to figure out the safest way to travel. We called our local hospital and tried to get an ambulance and they couldn&rsquo;t work it out.&nbsp;We&rsquo;re like ok, we can fly. We called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/airlift\">airlift </a>and they say it wasn&rsquo;t technically an emergency because I wasn&rsquo;t being rushed over from the hospital. Finally, an ambulance took me to the airport and I got on a plane. Once we landed at the transplant city I was then driven to the transplant center. I arrived five minutes before 8pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was told my transplant would take 8-10 hours, but it only took five. The surgeon said they were pristine, white, fluffy lungs&hellip; young lungs&hellip; very, very good lungs. I was told I would be in the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/icu\">ICU </a>for three weeks but I was only there for barely three days. They told me I&rsquo;d be in the hospital for eight weeks and that I&rsquo;d come out still on a ventilator because I had been so dependent on it. But I was breathing so well in the operating room I was quickly down to two liters of oxygen breathing on my own. My doctor knew I was scared to get off the oxygen - that I&rsquo;d had an <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/pulse-oximeter\">oximeter </a>on my finger for a year and a half. She told me when I didn&rsquo;t need it and I kept telling her &lsquo;no, no, no don&rsquo;t turn it off&rsquo;. But she did turn it off, and I was at 95-99%! I&rsquo;ve never gone below, still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We moved to The Transplant House after being <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/discharged\">discharged </a>from the hospital. It was a great place, very close, and they did a fabulous job. They <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/returning-home\">sent us home</a> after two months instead of three or four. My doctor post-transplant was pretty excited with how things were going. I&rsquo;ve seen her three times and I don&rsquo;t have to go back for three months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>I knew my lung capacity wasn&rsquo;t up to where it eventually would be, but I already felt 20 years younger. Breathing-wise it was like I was in my twenties. I was obviously in pain for a lot of other reasons, but it was amazing. I&rsquo;d compare it to being underwater and starting to drown, and the feeling of relief when you come out. All the time I just couldn&rsquo;t breathe. <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/health-related-quality-of-life\">Life really changed</a> in that respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other thing that was huge and shocking to everyone in my life was that I no longer had the CF cough. My whole life I&rsquo;ve coughed up and spit out nasty junk. My grandfather told me that when I was a little, tiny boy, if you keep swallowing that, you&rsquo;re going to get sick. You need to spit it out, but do it respectfully. He said always make sure, don&rsquo;t you spit on the sidewalks. You make sure people don&rsquo;t have to look at it, and all those things. I learned how to do that. But when I got that lung transplant, and I was conscious for a while, I was like, I haven&rsquo;t coughed. And they said, nope, and you won&rsquo;t probably, either. I still have people I&rsquo;m working with today, who are so used to me, they&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you&rsquo;re coming. It&rsquo;s not the normal you.&rsquo; Because I&rsquo;m not coughing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/support-system\">support network</a> that was incredible. Not only my immediate family, also my parents, and my wife&rsquo;s parents and others. People that don&rsquo;t have what we had, don&rsquo;t have all those gifts and blessing, I don&rsquo;t know how people do this, honestly. I can see where it would be harder to get well, because there&rsquo;s so much to deal with, and not enough help. We had plenty of help, I would never say we didn&rsquo;t have enough. We couldn&rsquo;t have done it without all the help. That&rsquo;s a big factor. I don&rsquo;t know if anybody warns you about that part of it. My wife and my dad were my go to people the whole time I was sick. There was a lot of people that helped and gave assistance, but those two understood me the most and knew what I wanted the most. It was just kind of natural that way. I think it is really important to have more than one, because if you have one, it&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s a lot of work. My wife was basically a 24-hour caregiver for me, and trying to take care of two kids, and then all of the people trying to help us out, manage all that...manage doctors and nurses and medications, people praying for us, and services coming to us. There was so much, that&rsquo;s a lot to take on. When they tell you that you need two, maybe three helpers, that&rsquo;s no joke. It&rsquo;s definitely exhausting. They get worn out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t like taking medications, and I have a super high <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/pain-management\">pain tolerance</a>. I&rsquo;d rather not have to take them so often, but I totally understand what needs to be done. I ask a lot of questions, and the team has done a great job of informing me about the ones I need. We were diligent about figuring out what was unnecessary and getting off those. I&rsquo;m basically just on three <a href=\"http://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/anti-rejection-medication\">anti-rejection</a> medicines, which is <a href=\"http://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/tacrolimus\">tacro</a>, <a href=\"http://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/mycophenolate\">mycophenolate</a>, and only 10mg of <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/prednisone\">prednisone</a>. I get to go down to 5mg of prednisone in October, and I keep negotiating to try to get off it because the side effects are just horrendous on my body, most people&rsquo;s bodies. The tacro I&rsquo;ve done pretty well with. We&rsquo;ve had a couple of times when getting off of other drugs has made my tacro level adjust up and down. When the tacro level&nbsp;gets too high it looks like I&rsquo;m not super tolerant of it but I&rsquo;ve been tolerating it at low doses. They&rsquo;re trying to keep my tacro level between 8 and 10, a pretty low number. What happens with it, for some reason that I dislike the most, is how it makes my mouth kind of swell up, and then I bite my cheeks and my tongue a lot, then I get these sores in there. That&rsquo;s uncomfortable. But when the level is back down, it almost immediately goes away. That&rsquo;s a sign that I know I&rsquo;m too high on tacro. Then the other one, mycophenolate, I don&rsquo;t know if I have any side effects.</p>",

        "title": "My Take on Transplant",
        "content": "<p>My perspective on the whole mental, emotional, and even spiritual parts of transplant is that it has to do with living. When you are fighting infections and on a ventilator, it is pretty miserable. Transitioning from a ventilator to being capped with oxygen was very tough. It&rsquo;s a mental thing, on how you breathe. Your body can adjust, but it takes a little while.&nbsp;I would get tingly, I would get hot and sweaty, I would get freezing cold. I would go through all these weird feelings, sensations, and mentally have to deal with how to handle all of it.&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t just shut down. I had to think my way through a lot of it, and distract myself, toughen up to get through. It was hard. I kept trying, but it was difficult to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My wife and I talked a lot about that stuff, and we talked to our doctor at home about our options. She was always very good at giving us the hardcore facts, yet telling us what the hope was. There were a couple times when several of the ICU&nbsp;doctors told my wife that it wasn&rsquo;t looking good. When I told my doctor that I was scared, she told me that she was scared as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I definitely questioned, can my family handle me living like this, is it practical to continue living this way? It felt like being alive, but not a life. There was a lot going through my brain as far as living or dying, what life would look like. I wanted to live like I always had, a life where I could do a lot. I wanted to enjoy my kids. I have a wonderful wife and want to do stuff with her. I was looking down a road, whether it was slow or fast, of not really living life, but just being alive, and having a whole bunch of people have to give me assistance. That&rsquo;s not what I wanted. There is a lot that can go wrong and you have to depend a lot on people for a lot of things. There&rsquo;s only so much you can do. Life is meant to live it, and transplant gave me a life to live again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transplant also gave me a different perspective on life too. I had a lot going on before I had my heart attack, and I think &ndash; this is natural in life &ndash; we can allow all the outside circumstances and the negative stuff to overwhelm us and stress us out. Then we become negative about a lot of stuff and people. Jumpy and snappy, and just grumpy, and we forget to look at the good. This whole experience, especially coming through it, has really given me a different perspective on a whole lot of things in life. And I appreciate that. More than I think I would have if I wouldn&rsquo;t have had a lung transplant or even had this whole situation happen. Not that I really wanted to go through it all, but I&rsquo;m grateful for the whole experience, honestly. I feel blessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would offer the advice to other people to really go for it. Listen to your body, push, but don&rsquo;t overdo. Ask a lot of questions of your doctor. Be focused after transplant. Don&rsquo;t wait for nurses to ask you to walk or go do your therapies. Nurses are very busy, and you may have to be insistent because they have a lot of patients to handle and a lot on their plate. Push yourself, get help from somebody else. Do as much therapy and as much walking as you can, as often as you can, to the point where you don&rsquo;t need others walking with you anymore, then you can do it even more. It progresses. I think that speeds up everything. There were so many times walking around the hospital, doing my walks, and I was like, okay let&rsquo;s do it again. I pushed myself and pushed myself. And other people that had gotten transplants didn&rsquo;t want to walk, because it hurt and it was uncomfortable. And yeah, it hurt. You&rsquo;re uncomfortable. It&#39;s not fun. But it&rsquo;s just like any muscle, you&rsquo;ve got to keep working it and doing everything. Have a helper and push, that&rsquo;s what I say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a lot and emotional when you are waiting. But someone is giving you a piece of them, a life they would have lived. I feel a responsibility now to the donor family for what I&rsquo;ve been given. It makes you swallow hard. I don&rsquo;t ever want to take it for granted, I want to be active, helping, serving, working, being social, enjoying people. Smiling more than frowning. Just kind of living it up, responsibly.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">I knew that people got lung transplants, but I never really considered it for myself. There were so many unknowns. Would I be considered someone without cystic fibrosis after transplant? What would medications cost? What would be covered? What about the medical bills?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">My <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/lung-function\">lung function</a> had been declining pretty rapidly though. At first, I just went to my doctor to hear about it, to consider it, but then my body crashed and it became a conversation where it was the only option I had left. I knew I was the one who was making the decision, and I made that decision because I could feel I was actively dying. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">I switched my care to the transplant center 18 months before I got my transplant. There was a whole lifetime I had to catch them up on. I was very vocal and was trying to tell the team things about my body they might not have known. My interactions weren&rsquo;t that great. The <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/tests\">tests</a> themselves were fine, but the <a href=\"/resources/evaluation\">evaluation</a> was a lot. I wasn&rsquo;t getting a lot of answers. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">I read everything the doctors gave me. I looked at the material about the procedures that I would be going through for the evaluation workup beforehand, so I would know what was going on. My insurance sent me paperwork about <a href=\"http://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/advance-care-planning\">advanced directives</a>, things I read all the way through. But I tried not to get too much into the technical parts of it because it is really easy to get scared off. With surgery<u>,</u> there is a risk of death. I looked at enough to be aware of what was happening and to mentally prepare for the transplant. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">I actually would have liked to hear from a doctor about exactly what&rsquo;s done in the procedure. I didn&rsquo;t know that there was wire implanted in my chest, to hold my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/sternum\">sternum</a> together. I wish I had known how many <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/chest-tubes\">tubes</a> were going to be put in, and about the trembling hands. I didn&rsquo;t know about those things and I would have liked to know. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There was a woman who went through a transplant who was able to tell me how she navigated the process, things like insurance and finances. I used her as a sounding board for the questions I had. I didn&rsquo;t go to transplant groups, I didn&rsquo;t feel it was for me. I am a naturally empathetic person and often let my feelings be overshadowed and under-prioritized by others&rsquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">My focus was literally keeping myself alive long enough to get through the process, to get to the end. That&rsquo;s what I put all my energy into. Making it through each day.</span></p>",

        "title": "The Call, The Transplant, & The Recovery",
        "content": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">I was thinking to myself, gosh is this going to happen soon enough? I was feeling my body declining and I was waiting for the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/call\">call</a>, to get closer to that. I had been on the waitlist for two months when I got my transplant. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">I was doing really well after transplant and it looked like I was going to get out earlier than expected. I qualified for <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/relocation\">housing</a> since I live an hour and a half from the hospital. I was told that as soon as I got admitted for the transplant, the process was then going to be started for finding and securing my local housing. But after five days in the hospital post-transplant, I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was going on. The nurses and dieticians were prepping me to be released, but arrangements for my housing hadn&rsquo;t happened. As I tried making all kinds of calls to get more information I was being met with a lot of hostility and non-answers from my assigned social worker. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">When I finally got to my original temporary accommodations there was just a general sense of uncleanliness. But we figured well I&rsquo;ll be in my room most of the time, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter. As the days wore on we became aware of the lack of housekeeping (this was important because there is a huge emphasis on the cleanliness of your environment directly after transplant) and the blatant disregard of the non-smoking signs plastered around the building. Think about how much stress I was under being only two weeks post-transplant. Now add in my fear of leaving my hotel room and having to navigate through smokers with my fresh lungs to get to my mom&rsquo;s car.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Also, add in how my mom is a single mom who had been watching her daughter die for two years, is so excited that she is alive, but now has to take over communicating on my behalf with a social worker who doesn&rsquo;t like me. But hey, we aren&rsquo;t done yet. Add in that I have a younger sister who just had her first baby 5 days after I had my transplant. A transplantee, a single mom, a 21-year-old new single mom, and an infant in one hotel room with sub-par accommodations, just trying to figure out where they&rsquo;re going to be living for the next three months as they try to figure out what their new normal is. Now, remember that post-transplant I was told that a lot of these stresses would be addressed and taken care of by my social worker.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Being a Black woman with cystic fibrosis (a disease that is notoriously known to be had by near exclusively white folks) and being a Black woman navigating through the healthcare system in general, I am more than used to actions toward me becoming racially charged when I try to advocate for myself. But this situation led me to feel more alone than ever because I was more vulnerable than I had ever been. Here it is these folks held my literal life in their hands and I was being treated like a problem. And when I would try to express what was going on and my feelings to my doctors and other folks in charge of my care (besides my nurses, they were quite lovely) I was met with this white coat of a wall where no one seemed to want to hold anyone accountable or even express empathy toward my situation or say flat out, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been treated the way I was and no other patient should either. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">I lost a lot of trust in all my doctors during that time. During the time I should have just been happy that I could finally breathe. It took a long time to even gain <em>some</em> of that trust back. To this day I haven&rsquo;t been able to thank anyone for my transplant besides the nurses who took care of me in the hospital and my surgeon. Everyone else seemed very much against me or simply unempathetic toward the way I was treated. Even before I decided to go forward with the transplant, I was met with a lot of scare tactics, hostility, a lack of understanding, false information, and questions about my commitment to the process. The folks who have the final say-so of whether or not you&rsquo;re worthy of receiving a transplant have to realize they&rsquo;re able-bodied people assessing us folks whose bodies have been failing us since the day we were born (in a CFers case). And that all of our energy pre-transplant is put into keeping ourselves alive and hoping that when we go to sleep at night, we&rsquo;ll wake up the next morning. </span></p>",

        "content": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">After the transplant, the rules were completely different. I felt surprised when things weren&rsquo;t how I expected. Breathing wise, I feel better than I ever have before. Which is a pretty low bar to top, considering how low my lung function was before transplant. Better than before doesn&rsquo;t automatically mean, better. It has been over a year since my transplant, and I still <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/numbness\">can&rsquo;t feel my chest</a>. I didn&rsquo;t get my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/taste\">sense of taste</a> back until over a month or two after transplant. My <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/hand-tremors\">hands still shake</a> consistently. Being a multi-media artist, this is something that affects me daily. Something I&rsquo;ve had to work around and caused me to have to relearn things that came so easily to me before. My muscles still seem non-existent at times. I can count on my breathing while I exercise but I can&rsquo;t count on my body yet. Having a metal rod in my back from a spinal fusion and insulin-dependent <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/diabetes\">diabetes</a> makes it hard to just jump into exercising. I wasn&rsquo;t a super active person pre-transplant because I didn&rsquo;t have the strength or breathing capacity to do so. It&rsquo;s difficult to just switch your mindset in that way. I find it hard to explain this to people, family, friends, and doctors alike. There seems to be an assumption that because I can breathe, I should be able to jump into exercise like a normal person. But it&rsquo;s not that simple and it&rsquo;s hard to explain that to people. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">I&rsquo;m still very much learning how to breathe. I&rsquo;m still very much getting used to the idea that I might have more years ahead of me than I&rsquo;d previously imagined. I&rsquo;m still very much coming to accept all the scars on my body. I&rsquo;m still very much learning and acknowledging that my body belongs to me and not the medical system. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">As I learn, get used to, and acknowledge all these new things I&rsquo;m creating a new normal. In this new normal I have many dislikes and loves. I dislike how long it&rsquo;s taking my feet and legs to get used to all this weight I&rsquo;ve finally been able to put on. I love that I&rsquo;ve been able to put on all this weight and look overall, healthier. I dislike all the side effects I&rsquo;ve had to experience while regulating my medicines and levels to a stable place. I love that I don&rsquo;t have to do breathing treatments anymore. I dislike my hand tremors. I love that I now have the energy to create again, and at a level I wasn&rsquo;t able to before my decline started. I dislike the new depressive and anxiety-driven episodes I&rsquo;ve had to navigate as I reconcile with what comes next. I love that I believe in a <em>next</em> now, at all. I dislike how hard it is for my muscles to catch up to where I want them to be. I love how the energy and little bit of muscles I do have now allow me to chase after my 1-year-old niece and run around with my 11-year-old nephew. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There are ups and downs in my transplant story. What is clear to me is that I need to feel like my doctors are listening and willing to learn. Yes, they have degrees and can understand the numbers that make me dizzy. But they aren&rsquo;t living in my body. They don&rsquo;t have to carry themselves as if they are the smartest person in the room for me to respect them. My respect goes to doctors who listen, recognize that each patient is different, are willing to learn, and hold themselves and their colleagues accountable. </span></p>",

        "content": "<p>I have lived the past 50 years of my life independently and resolved to not let my CF get in the way of doing the things I love. I completed my engineering degree, got married, had a family, and had a fulfilling career working full time for 31 years as an engineer, technologist, and strategic planner. I&rsquo;ve been lucky to travel internationally for business and pleasure. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve always participated in many sports and activities that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed. I have a wonderful wife and family, which now includes two granddaughters. These are things I&rsquo;m proud of, because from a young age I was told that the life expectancy for someone with CF was low and I&rsquo;ve done quite well. Prior to contemplating transplant as my health was declining, I had already gone through the process of <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/advance-care-planning\">preparing my finances, will, home, beneficiaries</a>, etc., such that if and when I passed, everything would easily transition to my wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really began noticing a decline in my health and an impact on my ability to do things in my 50&rsquo;s. I was having more <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/exacerbation\">exacerbations</a>, requiring oxygen, and spending more and more time in the hospital getting IV antibiotics. At the age of 53, I had to leave my career to be on <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/diability\">disability</a>. Things weren&#39;t getting better, and at 58 my CF doctor said it may be the last time to consider lung transplant as a treatment option. We had talked about lung transplant before, and I had always said &ldquo;Nope, I&#39;ll just live life as best I can.&rdquo; I have always had the attitude of &ldquo;do the best in life with the cards that I&#39;ve been given.&rdquo; Transplant wasn&#39;t something I saw for myself. My doctor told me that I was now at the point where I needed to decide if that&rsquo;s really my final decision. He emphasized that my health wasn&rsquo;t getting any better, and I would need to be strong enough to get through some tough <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/evaluation\">evaluation</a> tests if I did decide to go down that route. &ldquo;You&#39;re healthy enough to get through the evaluation process now, but in a few months, &nbsp;you might not be strong enough to get through the process. You&rsquo;re at that decision point where you need to make that final decision, transplant or no transplant.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My doctors have known me for many years and I trust their clinical knowledge. I really appreciated this honest and straightforward approach that made me aware of where I was. It forced me think about whether I should re-consider transplant as a treatment option for myself. After that appointment, my wife and I set out to research more about lung transplant. To my surprise, the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/survival-statistics\">survival statistics</a> had improved a lot! The numbers I was using were outdated. I thought people lived maybe five years after transplant. But new data said it has really increased, and 9-10 years was a realistic outcome. A lot of people are living much longer than that. We did a lot of reading online and the more we got educated we began to understand the good that could come with a lung transplant. Yes, it was going to be hard, but this seemed to be the best path and there was real hope for a good outcome. We decided that we should go ahead with a referral and start the evaluation process &ndash; I could always say no. I like to describe myself as a very competitive and goal-oriented individual. Once I do my research and set my mind to something, it is full steam ahead with no looking back. When I decided to go through with an evaluation for lung transplant, I never wavered from that decision. I made it my goal to prepare for transplant, be the best candidate I could be, and to prepare as best possible for what I could expect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the evaluation process I spent 10 days at the hospital going through a battery of tests. That was tough, there were a lot of unpleasant tests. I pushed through those and everything was looking good, but my weight was an issue and my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/bmi\">BMI</a> was right on the line (too low) which was concerning for the transplant evaluation committee.&nbsp; I was getting really thin, and slowly losing more and more weight because my health was getting worse. The transplant center said I needed to get my weight up before being listed, either by getting a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/feeding-tube\">feeding tube</a> or by showing them I could gain weight. I spent the next three weeks focusing on eating &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t feel like eating due to all my therapies, but I was eating. I would check in weekly with my nutritionist, getting extra help, and after three weeks I was able to gain six pounds. That extra weight was enough to increase my BMI into acceptable ranges for my transplant center, and I was able to get listed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing up I never made CF a part of me. I never sought out CF relationships, and didn&#39;t know of anyone who had been through a lung transplant. My wife and I joined a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/support-group\">support group</a> at my transplant center and connected with patients who were like me and some who had been through the transplant process. I called three or four people just to get more information. They told me their outcomes were much better than I had visualized in my mind for people post-transplant and they educated me on what was needed from your <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/caregiver\">caregiver</a> support system. Talking to people and engaging in the support group were key in giving me a better idea of what to expect and what to plan for. I was able to find mentors who helped me through the time waiting for my lungs. During the waiting period I focused most on preparing my strength prior to surgery. I worked with a physical therapist&nbsp;and did <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/pulmonary-rehabilitation\">pulmonary rehabilitation</a> on stand-up sit-down exercises and walking. I set my goals based on post-transplant patients with a &ldquo;fast recovery.&rdquo; Because you are going to get so weak after surgery, the stronger you are, the faster you can get out of bed. The faster you can get out of bed, the faster you can start walking. The faster you start walking, the faster you can get out of the hospital. And that&rsquo;s the key, getting out of the hospital and getting on that recovery path. If you&rsquo;re not strong, you can&rsquo;t get out of bed, and things go a whole lot slower.</p>",

Since we had to drive almost 4 hours to get to our transplant center, we had a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/travel-plan\">travel plan</a> (with flight backup) and our bags were packed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 197 days (about 7 months), we got the call at 10:15am. They asked that we be in the hospital by 7pm for surgery the next morning. We loaded our bags, made the three and a half hour drive, and arrived at the hospital. We checked in for my room, and went through some <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/pre-op-tests\">pre-op tests</a> including an X-Ray, and vital signs. Later that evening I had some family visitors, including my mother, sister, and son. The next morning, I was taken into the pre-op at 8am.&nbsp; At 10:45, I said goodbye to my wife and was wheeled into the operating room. I was scared, but I remained confident that I would have a good outcome and that I would come out happy and breathing clearly. While many calls lead to dry runs, I was lucky and mine was the real thing. My surgery took a little over 12 hours. By 11pm I was in my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/icu\">ICU </a>room with my wife, <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/intubated\">intubated</a>, but responding to simple commands. My surgeon told my wife that &ldquo;of the thousands of surgeries he has done, my surgery was in his top ten most difficult. The scarring on the left side of my lungs was unbelievable.&rdquo; He commented that he was amazed I was able to breathe at all before transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/extubated\">extubated</a> about 24 hours after surgery and was able to take my first breath. It was the first day of &ldquo;Chapter 2&rdquo; and I was focused on recovering back to health. My first food was Jello, but soon I started eating full meals. I started moving between my bed and the chair.&nbsp; I took my first walk three days after surgery. I was very tired. I felt like I was sleep walking, but I wanted to walk. I was glad I was not in a lot of pain. My nurses would ask for my pain rating from 0-10 and I&rsquo;d say 1. They never believed me, and said it was supposed to be around 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lung transplant surgery is complicated, and I had a setback that required a second <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/intubated\">intubation</a>. My team thought it was possibly <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/sepsis\">sepsis</a>, but it was probably too much pain medication that was making me drowsy and driving a negative reaction to my system. But in a couple of days I was up and walking again. By day nine, I was doing well enough to be transferred out of the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/icu\">ICU </a>and to a recovery unit. I was able to eat a full breakfast meal and was getting more confident with every step during each walk. I was re-learning how to get dressed and working up my strength to get out of a seated position on my own. You have to be particularly careful with your <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/sternum\">sternum</a>, since it is broken and repaired during surgery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Watch your <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/restrictions\">restrictions</a>&rdquo; was a common nurse&rsquo;s comment. I had occasional visitors from my sons, family, and close friends.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to be seen much in my condition with <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/chest-tubes\">drain tubes</a>, <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/wires\">wires</a>, and hospital gown. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On day 15 after my surgery, my care team decided I was ready to be <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/discharged\">discharged</a>. I left the hospital with my Superman t-shirt on and was using a walker on my own. My <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/oxygen-saturation\">oxygen saturation</a> level was at 100% and my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/pulmonary-function-test\">pulmonary function test</a> showed my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/fev1\">FEV1</a> was now 66% predicted. Although this was lower than I had imagined, I was still early in my recovery and as I regained my strength I was reassured by my doctors that it would go up with time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being discharged, I was required to <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/relocation\">stay near the hospital</a> for regular evaluations and check-ups. Our housing, known as our &ldquo;transplant house,&rdquo; was at my sister&rsquo;s home which was conveniently located near the transplant center. As part of my recovery outside of the hospital, my wife and I spent a lot of time walking around this new city we were in and I was able to regain my strength by being tourists and exploring parks and local attractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After five weeks at my transplant house, we were able to <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/returning-home\">return home</a>. The normal time to be sent home is usually about three months. I felt accomplished with my timeline of seven and a half weeks after transplant surgery. I can confidently say that none of this would have been possible without my wonderful wife who was my support, caregiver, motivator, and rock throughout this journey. To celebrate the new life my lungs provided, we decided to have our wedding rings re-blessed at the church where we were married 36 years prior.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Since I was 14 years old, I was always in and out of the hospital, dealing with anywhere from three to nine <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/exacerbation\">exacerbations</a> per year. Transplant was always an idea that I kept in the back of my mind. By the time I hit around 23 my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/fev1\">FEV1</a>, <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/pulmonary-function-test\">lung function</a>, started tanking more and more. When I was 23-25 years old I already had an FEV1 of 30%.&nbsp; There was one specific year when things started getting pretty drastic. I remember when it happened, it was December. I had just gone to what I thought was going to be a typical doctor&rsquo;s appointment. I think the exact words I was given were something along the lines of, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely if you don&rsquo;t get this lung transplant, you&rsquo;re not going to see past&nbsp;your 31st birthday.&rdquo; At the time, I was 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was told, &ldquo;you have a choice here if you want to do this or not.&rdquo; But if I&#39;m honest, I didn&rsquo;t really have a lot of time to interpret or think about whether I should or I shouldn&rsquo;t. It felt like a necessity. I really thought there&rsquo;s an urgency to this. Am I even going to make it? Am I going to actually get the lungs before I die? The decision to be referred felt so fast that I didn&rsquo;t even really have much time to process it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never in my life have I been so anxious. I was very nervous as to what life would be like after transplant if the lung transplant is a success. What if it&rsquo;s not? What happens? I thought about if I don&rsquo;t have CF after transplant, what is my life going to be like? Am I going to be healthy and that&rsquo;s it? Do I have what I need in my life to live a normal, suitable life after&hellip; when I&#39;m &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;? There were so many topics to think about. It&rsquo;s a lot. You try to maneuver around it as best as you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had to prepare, and quickly. But it took a year, a year and a half, to <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/evaluation\">figure everything all out</a> and for me to be listed. I had to wait six months before I could even talk to the transplant team because I had to establish care with the local CF clinic due to a complicated <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/adherence\">adherence</a> issue. It was excruciating, frustrating, and I had extreme anxiety. After the six months of waiting, I did the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/tests\">work up</a> and in one year&#39;s worth of time I got the transplant. And during the time I was waiting, I tried to prepare mentally. I was lucky to have a therapist who knows CF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a really good CF doctor - I connected with him and really appreciated that. Another person that really influenced me was my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/nutrition\">nutritionist</a>. I knew my eating habits were pretty poor. My BMI was low.<span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp;</span>I realized I needed to be in direct contact with my nutritionist to ask her what to do about my diet. That information absolutely helped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did lot of research and figured out what transplant was all about. I was fortunate to have a friend who is a nurse as a resource, who helped me understand what to expect. You can read exactly how transplant works. So my logical side was taken care of. That knowledge strengthened my whole emotional and psychological well-being, and put me more at ease. Understanding for instance, what is a clamshell, the incision that they do. I wondered why don&rsquo;t they cut down instead of right across? Things like that. I tried to just figure out what I could as best as I could, because I came from the mentality that this is obviously a huge deal, and it would be best to have myself educated as best I can. I felt decent about it. If I had questions, I would figure out the answers. I&rsquo;m self-sufficient in that way.</p>",

Writing the details about this occurrence would be a whole different story in itself. The odds of surviving were truly unknown.

Your care team is there, I believe, to give you the resources, but you&rsquo;ve got to do all the heavy lifting yourself. Looking back, I can see that prednisone really affected my energy and mindset, as well as focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After you get the transplant, your health and your quality of life substantially rises. You have to change. If your transplant is successful, you aren&rsquo;t going to be living the way you were before. I needed a clear direction, and needed to figure out how to best succeed. There are steps you can take to know you are doing your best. Life was colored by the experience of having a completely new quality of life and health. <em>It is like the lowest of the low to the highest of the high</em>. I had so much more happiness. I was glowing and could see love everywhere. It was the honeymoon period of getting a new life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were some challenges with it though. I went through being sick my whole life and it was hard to break the mold. I had anxiety about what to do in life. I suppose there is a part of me that still sees myself as that sick person. The biggest challenge has been to work through that and tell myself that&rsquo;s not me anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right out of transplant I started working out, hanging out with friends. I felt freedom. I was able to breathe and do more activity. What was extremely powerful was the rebirth of sorts from being critical and end-stage.

To me, that was the hardest part. The ache of isolation and seeing how no one in your life is going through what you&rsquo;re going through. There are people worse off than you, and simultaneously you may surround yourself with people with extremely great health. But damn near no one is going through what you&rsquo;re going through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I&rsquo;ve learned is that our physical health will bleed into our mental and emotional health. At end stage, you&rsquo;ll need to keep this in mind. This is going to be the most challenging time in your life. Not just your life, but those who love you as well. My advice is to find something to fight for. If you can stomach being around people, try as best as you can to do so. You are at the end of your current life, with hope that you may have another chance. Learn how to fight every day to achieve that second chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There gets to be a point while waiting where you&rsquo;re just too tired to want to fight. But at some point, I was like, I want to continue to live. You&rsquo;ve got to believe in your own future. I had a couple of friends and some family members that would tell me I had great value to them. They were supportive, and there for me. You being around is important, so you need to fight. That&rsquo;s what I tried to remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I heard &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going to need a transplant, you&#39;re going to need to be evaluated,&rdquo; I knew I had a purpose. I had to develop that purpose. I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;okay, this is all I&#39;m going to do. I&rsquo;m going to be focused on how I can enjoy my life as best I can with the limited health that I have, and prepare for the transplant.&rdquo; My mission: to enjoy life, to fight, and to inspire.</p>",

When it dropped that low, my doctor said, &lsquo;I think we&rsquo;re going to have to start thinking about lung transplant fairly soon.&rsquo; When he said, &ldquo;fairly soon&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t really know what that meant. A month? A year. I finally asked him to clarify.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI continued to get sick that year, and after a couple of more exacerbations my doctor said that maybe I should go to the nearest transplant center (in another state) and meet the team. His reasoning was that he wanted me to be <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/evaluation\">evaluated </a>while I was still fairly healthy, that way I could stay ahead of the process rather than be put in the situation of needing an emergent transplant and having the potential to be denied for being too sick.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe was very proactive. He said that he&rsquo;d like me to go to find out what it would take for me <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/evaluation\">to be listed</a>. We knew I was going to keep getting sick, and he said that if I got in the system I would be ready to go when I needed the transplant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My doctor knew a lot of the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/tests\">tests</a> the transplant center would need to do and ordered many for me to do preemptively before I traveled down there. He did tests he was able to get insurance to cover. That made the two weeks of testing and <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/evaluation\">evaluation</a> at the transplant center a little easier and less grueling.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGoing into the first meeting with the transplant team I was under the impression that I was borderline eligible for transplant. I didn&rsquo;t have in my head that I was actually going to be listed. I knew that I was getting sicker though, as I had been pretty sick that whole year, and I was on <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/supplemental-oxygen\">oxygen at night</a>; and my oxygen needs were getting to be more. At the same time, I didn&rsquo;t feel that sick. I thought I was just being proactive and getting established with a team so that when I did fall below that threshold of &ldquo;sick enough to be listed&rdquo; I would have everything ready.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, once I got to the transplant center and met the doctors they wasted no time. Four months after being evaluated they were ready to list me and I moved to a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/relocation\">new state</a> to be near the transplant center. At that point I didn&rsquo;t feel that sick, I was actually feeling pretty good. A couple of months before, I had asked, &ldquo;do I even need to come here, or can we wait?&rdquo; They said no to waiting, because I needed a lung and liver transplant which had a longer <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/wait-list\">waitlist</a> time than lungs alone. They told me I should be listed as soon as possible while I was healthier so I could be strong enough for the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was helpful to hear from my online transplant <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/support-group\">support group</a> about the things that were most difficult for people, things that I could mentally prepare for. I was also reassured by the amount of success that transplant seems to have. To learn that people with CF can expect <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/life-expectancy\">10 years</a>, or even more, after transplant. That the percentage of people experiencing really bad symptoms, or <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/rejection\">rejection</a>, within the first few years is not as significant as I would have expected. I knew how long you spend in the hospital after transplant varies for everyone and the liver transplant makes it more involved. Thankfully, I made a friend who had double lung and liver transplant recently. It was helpful that my mom and I actually got to meet his mom, and my mom got to go and see him. So that was really good, and supportive&nbsp;for my mom.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe transplant training was good information but we all left going, &lsquo;what more do we need to know how to do?&nbsp;When we get the call, where do we go? To which door? Where do we park?&rsquo; I feel like the caretakers are kind of at a disadvantage because they need to try to figure out when to give help or not. They&rsquo;re dealing with an adult who has been taking care of themselves their whole life who finds it hard to let people help. I didn&rsquo;t have a sense of really how to talk to my <a href=\"http://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/caregiver\">caregivers</a> about job descriptions for them, even after the transplant training.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the things I knew as I mentally prepared for this transition was that if I was going to come here and be on a waitlist for an unknown period of time, my sole job could not be waiting. I thought then about what I could be able to do with the&nbsp;time, as if it was a sabbatical. I know that that is definitely not the case for everybody that&rsquo;s waiting for a transplant, that it&rsquo;s such a mixed bag. I&rsquo;ve been very, very fortunate. I&rsquo;m grateful I was&nbsp;still able to be pretty independent. I think it would have been infinitely harder if I&#39;d been&nbsp;dependent&nbsp; on oxygen during the day, or getting around, or I&#39;d needed more home care. I did&nbsp;need more help with daily activities when I got an <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/exacerbation\">exacerbation</a>. So again, I&rsquo;m very grateful that I was&nbsp;listed sooner, but also the reality is that being listed sooner meant I had to wait longer.</p>",

Plus, I had it in my head that I didn&rsquo;t want to improve too much to kick me off the wait list, when I&rsquo;d worked so hard and already waited so long for my transplant. But I was also getting exacerbations much more frequently and my quality of life was suffering. So, I decided to try Symdeko and it seemed to help keep me a little more stable.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was such a head game being on the transplant list: On one hand I would worry/wonder: &ldquo;maybe I don&rsquo;t need a transplant if this medication works&hellip;?&rdquo; and on the other, I didn&rsquo;t want to improve too much because I didn&rsquo;t want to wait longer to get transplanted.&nbsp;Once Trikafta was put on the market, my doctors pretty quickly wanted to make sure I had access to it. I&rsquo;d read about other people being on it who had received early access to it, so I felt comfortable starting it. My doctor made it clear that it would be unlikely that I would become healthy enough to be taken off the list, because I need both lung and liver transplants. But that it would help me improve my symptoms, which it did. Not drastically--it can&rsquo;t reverse existing damage. For example, it can&rsquo;t heal scarring. It can help you clear out mucus that maybe you had trouble clearing before, which is great. If I had started off being able to take it when my lungs were a little bit healthier, I think I could have gotten more of an effect.&nbsp;But it was&nbsp;really helpful&nbsp;in helping me stay as stable as I could.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe biggest boon was how it made coughing and doing breathing treatments a lot easier. I used to have good days and bad days with coughing, and major coughing spells came and went. But it had&nbsp;been years since I got a sustained reprieve from excessive coughing. Maybe a week here or there, but it would sneak up on me always. Suddenly&nbsp;I coughed a ton less&mdash;probably 80% less. That&rsquo;s huge.&nbsp; My body didn&#39;t produce the same amount of mucus that it did before. When I would wake up in the morning, my body was so different: I didn&#39;t immediately have&nbsp;to do&nbsp;breathing treatments before I could&nbsp;even function. I had&nbsp;more energy too, I wasn&#39;t&nbsp;as exhausted after doing breathing treatments. I could&nbsp;also go out in public with a lot less anxiety&nbsp;about having a coughing fit or getting out of breath. Now with COVID-19, that feels even more important. Everybody looks at you like you&rsquo;re literally passing death around if you&rsquo;re coughing. There were times before Trikafta where I would be on the bus or something, and because I&rsquo;d gotten out of breath getting to the bus, when I got on the bus and my body relaxed I would usually start coughing a ton. So often I would just cough practically the whole ride. It was never comfortable to be out, and I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I just wasn&rsquo;t going out, or staying at home. I would go out for a walk, but I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily going to go hang out in a coffee shop, because I figured it&rsquo;s just not going to be comfortable for me. After I went on Trikafta, it definitely was immediately a relief. I could&nbsp;actually do things in a way that felt&nbsp;more comfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was&nbsp;mentally hard&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t like thinking I could get healthy enough to get off the transplant list and then have to go through the evaluation all over again. I wanted to stay on the transplant list and get a transplant and get that over with, so I could&nbsp;move on to the next stage of my life&nbsp;post-transplant, rather than to have to go back to the beginning. Because I&rsquo;d already started this, and gotten my head around it and done all that work for it, I wasn&#39;t going to give that up. I wanted to knuckle down and get it done. Even if Trikafta had improved my lungs enough to be delisted, I still would have been in a kind of limbo with semi-good lungs. You&rsquo;re not healed. You&rsquo;re just at various levels of fragility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhen you&rsquo;re on the transplant list, you&rsquo;re not just in a queue, with whoever is next getting the next available organs. You have a <a href=\"http://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/lung-allocation-score\">score</a> that is determined by a lot of different numbers, which is good as it allows people that are really sick to get transplanted first, no matter how long they&rsquo;ve been on the transplant list. The doctors&nbsp;told me they would&nbsp;know when the lungs were right for me--because of size and height--but that didn&#39;t&nbsp;tell me much about when I could get <a href=\"http://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/call\">called</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIt was&nbsp;a mental and emotional roller coaster, almost more than a physical one. I was kind of in limbo. The&nbsp;fear of not knowing how sick I had&nbsp;to be in order to trigger my turn being up.&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know if I should want to get sicker so I could&nbsp;get transplanted sooner.&nbsp;My quality of life was pretty good. I didn&rsquo;t need oxygen, and I was&nbsp;able to stay involved with my art and writing, as well as few online groups I hosted and attended. But all it would take was an exacerbation and I&rsquo;d&nbsp;be done in and in bed for a week or two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nI was at a low point right before I started taking Trikafta. I was totally exhausted and so it was a huge relief and gave me a much-needed boost. It&rsquo;s a fantastic resource that can prolong living with your body the way that you were born with it. But I&rsquo;ve realized there is no right or wrong way in choosing what treatments or options are right for you. I think we have to use the medical tools that we have available to us. Transplant is something that we have available. But I would hesitate to say transplant should be looked at as &ldquo;a last resort.&rdquo; If your body needs a transplant, it should be fine to get a transplant. And if your body responds really positively to Trikafta, great. But also, there are some people that can&rsquo;t take modulators, or that have horrible side effects when on them. I think it&rsquo;s important to celebrate the possibilities, that people can prolong their lives and have a better quality of life. But at the same time, to make sure that people understand that getting a transplant isn&rsquo;t a failure of something. It&rsquo;s an opportunity also. If your body needs that then your body needs it, and let it be what it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSomething important for doctors, healthcare workers, and other people to be aware of is the cost of drugs like Orkambi and Trikafta. Something I&rsquo;ve talked about with people is the anxiety I had about not being able to take it anymore, or not taking it correctly. The weirdness of taking a drug that costs as much as a house down payment every month is a strange feeling that can cause a lot of anxiety and worry - what if insurance denies you at some point, what if you can&rsquo;t afford to take it... It&rsquo;s such an expensive lifeline, that you literally take every day, and your insurance has to approve every month. We need advocacy, so we can have access to it. It concerns me that it would be an elite drug, when it has such significant quality of life results for people. Some people may be already doing pretty good, and can start living in a way that they couldn&rsquo;t before. A daily existence they didn&rsquo;t think was possible. But unintended side effects for something you are so dependent on is also to be respected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nI think we have to understand the mental and emotional burden, and patterns that we get stuck in. I think sometimes we can get so stuck in our heads, especially when it&rsquo;s about listening to our bodies. We think we know our bodies, and then Trikafta, this is an important part to add&ndash; every single person that I&rsquo;ve communicated with&nbsp;said to me, I don&rsquo;t know my body anymore. It doesn&rsquo;t act the way that I&rsquo;m used to. I&rsquo;m having to relearn it all over again. That is a significant thing, because we don&rsquo;t often acknowledge just how intricately we have come to know our bodies, and come to know the signs. The CF doctors are always really good about telling me, &ldquo;You know your body best.&rdquo; But at the same time, if we know our body best and then suddenly we don&rsquo;t know our bodies, that&rsquo;s a significant anxiety point. Because then it could be our fault if we get worse, or we didn&rsquo;t pay attention to a sign that we didn&rsquo;t know to pay attention to.&nbsp;The great thing about Trikafta was that I didn&rsquo;t have all the symptoms anymore, but it was also disorienting and frustrating that I didn&rsquo;t know the warning signs of an exacerbation like I had previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis sounds kind of extreme, but I think I do mean it: is it better for your mental health to not take Trikafta? Is it better to get a transplant? I think it&rsquo;s important to know that there isn&rsquo;t a clear right answer for the next step a lot of times. I think within all of it, it&rsquo;s really important to make sure that you have a very clear sense of what your values are. And what quality of life is for you. It&nbsp;is a mental game. It really does take compassionate listening with somebody else when you get stuck in your head. We can make these decisions on our own, but at the same time, I really need my husband to be like, no, this is what I&rsquo;m seeing. And I need my doctor to be like, this is what I&rsquo;m seeing. I need to be able to trust them to be looking at me from a compassionate, helpfully, critical thinking lens. There&rsquo;s natural suffering, and then there&rsquo;s unnecessary suffering, and the work is to discern between the two so you can address what needs addressing, and let the rest of it be.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>We were told originally that we may not have our two sons with CF much longer than age 12. But things changed very quickly. We made sure that we were very proactive. We did all the therapies, from the time they were little. The clapping &ndash; all of the things. We would always talk with the boys about never using CF&nbsp;as an excuse not to do something. You&rsquo;re going to get out there, and if you want to do sports, we&rsquo;re going to do it. And you&rsquo;re going to go to school. Early on, I would plant myself in the library and read the newest articles, look at anatomy books, and try to understand functions affected by the disease. I would read about the treatments. That was what I needed to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it came to the transplant, the whole idea all of those years was, we&rsquo;re going to do everything we can. I felt that my sons would probably never need a transplant. Our whole thing around transplant, from the time they were diagnosed, was it&rsquo;s a last resort. When we did learn a little bit about it, very early on when the boys were young, it almost seemed like a stopgap measure. It&rsquo;s going to buy a little bit of time, and then oh my gosh, do the lungs re-infect? Are we in for two or three transplants? What is this all about? It was so big and seemed so distant, that we hoped we would never have to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it came down to my son Jacob needing one, it was very scary. Not knowing what lay ahead in the future. You start spiraling out a little bit. When we got to that point, it was hurry up and learn. We knew of a couple of people that went through it, many people that had not made it through, or <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/rejection\">rejected</a> years later. We didn&rsquo;t even know what was the best information or statistics. It was quick. We went in for all the meetings and there was so much information coming at us very quickly. They threw out <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/survival-statistics\">numbers and averages</a>. I didn&rsquo;t hear everything, it was hard to listen objectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jake was told, you probably should start thinking about this. His doctor told him &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not quite ready for it yet, but you&rsquo;re definitely heading in that direction.&rdquo; He had made the decision, after looking on the internet and different things, that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do this. I&rsquo;m not going to take my family through something I&rsquo;m not going to survive. It sounds horrible.&rdquo; Then as he got sicker, one of the home infusion nurses put him in touch with somebody who had had the surgery, who was about his age and other kinds of things. A lot of parallels. We went to meet with them, and then said, &ldquo;okay I think I can do this&rdquo;, and he made the decision to have the transplant.</p>",

        "content": "<p>By the time he made the decision he was spiraling down so quickly. He had dragged his feet, got the flu, and things had really gone downhill. He was literally in his 11th hour. We were in the hospital, and he was on ten liters of <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/low-oxygen\">oxygen</a>, and they said there&rsquo;s really nothing more we can do here. We&rsquo;re going to send you home tomorrow. And that is the first time, and the only time, he ever said to me, I am not worth this. There&rsquo;s nothing I can do, I&rsquo;m not going to survive this. I just was, stop. We&rsquo;re going to continue to fight this. There&rsquo;s more, I know there&rsquo;s more. And that&rsquo;s when we got the call, that night at about 11:30, midnight, that he was going to get the lungs. The expectation, I think, from some of the docs was that he wasn&rsquo;t going to make it through. But he worked very, very hard, and he had such a big heart for it, and such a good attitude. I&rsquo;m going to do this. And he did, he worked really hard. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had his same port when he went in to get his transplant. When he went into pre-op, the nurse was not familiar with his port, and tried to access it a couple of times. He said, just call my mom in here. I gowned up and accessed the port. For me, it was easy because I had been doing it for years. It was just not something that they were familiar with. The same thing happened on the floor. And I said, you can watch me, or I&rsquo;ll walk you through it. Either way, I can do it.&nbsp; It had to be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are foundations out there &ndash; there&rsquo;s support. Not just to pay for a transplant. Jake happened to fall under Obamacare at the time that first came out. We were prepared to put up our house, and every belonging that we had, because his insurance had a cap. He was working. We were going to fill that gap but we were $300,000 short. Okay here&rsquo;s our house title. We pushed that through the little pay window, and they said, we can&rsquo;t do that. But very soon after that, the cap was lifted, Obamacare came into effect and his whole surgery was covered. Meanwhile our family, friends and EMS in our county started fundraising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then there&rsquo;s all the ancillary stuff. The hotel or the apartment to stay in that you have to be <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/relocation\">close to the hospital</a>. The food, the gas, all of that. There are places that cover that, that can help with that. And you don&rsquo;t have to feel, well I&rsquo;m on assistance. Or Medicaid, thinking I probably don&rsquo;t qualify for that. You do. There&rsquo;re people that really want to help. Jake decided to start a foundation for people that were in his position with the money that was being raised by the fundraising being done by family, friends and EMS family. It exists today and has benefited two other CF patients working on lung transplant and his brother Derek.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/caregiver\">caregiver</a>, you need someone to talk to. You should also talk to someone who has been through it. I&rsquo;ve had people tell me, you&rsquo;ve been through it twice. When we went through it later with his younger brother, we heard, &ldquo;oh you&rsquo;ve already been through it, this is going to be a breeze.&rdquo; No, it&rsquo;s not going to be a breeze. I still have my son on an operating table. To me, it was still dire type circumstances. A big deal. People had no point of reference, it wasn&rsquo;t that they were being uncaring or anything. They were trying to be supportive, but they had no frame of reference. Every experience is different. Even if you&rsquo;ve been through it two times or more. There are probably families that have been through more than we have been through. It&rsquo;s okay to be angry, it&rsquo;s okay to be sad, it&rsquo;s okay to be happy. And it&rsquo;s okay when you feel guilty, someone can tell you, let&rsquo;s talk through it. Don&rsquo;t just put a label on it and say, well you shouldn&rsquo;t or you should. That kind of support. If we could get good at putting more of that together, I think that would be great. For the families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After his transplant, Jake stayed in the hospital for a while. Later, when his brother Derek had a transplant, he just breezed through. It was a total night and day experience with the two of them. Jake had a little bit more of a challenge. While Jake was in the hospital, we said okay, we&rsquo;re going to walk a little bit further every day. Even if it&rsquo;s a step. We started there, and before he went home, he was walking up and down the stairs inside the hospital. He had a lot of inspiration, he had a banner in his room signed by a whole conference of EMS (Emergency Medical Services) people. They were a big part of our support system.&nbsp;We have an absolutely huge <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/support-system\">support system</a>. I didn&rsquo;t even realize how big it was. My family, the boys, have had a tremendous outpouring of caring. When the boys were little, they thought some of the people that came to the house were relatives. We&rsquo;re very very fortunate in our situation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he got out of the hospital, we made sure that there was a place for him and his wife, and there was an extra bedroom so that we could come up and help. His wife had to learn all of that stuff too, to help out with it. He had dressings that needed to be changed. We used to call it silly string. The bandage that looked like continuous string, to pack in where his wound was. The first night, he was going to try and do it himself when he got home. It just kept coming and coming, and he kept getting greener and greener. I got a phone call saying, Mom you know what? I hate to ask you this, but can you come and help me change this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anything that he needed afterwards, or they needed, he and his wife, we were there and so were Mary&rsquo;s (his wife&rsquo;s) parents. Jake and Mary bought a house, ultimately, which was probably less than ten minutes from where we live. He knew what to do too, he was a go-getter. His wife had to learn how to do a lot too, how to take care of him. She is a trooper. The payoff was that they could do things again. They could go play tennis, they could go on a car trip, they could do things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though I knew there was a possibility of rejection or other issues, he looked so good after his transplant. Getting pink, gaining weight. His fingers weren&rsquo;t clubbed anymore. He was enjoying life. It was a time I could say, I&rsquo;m not afraid to be happy. I was hoping he would outlive me. It was easy to think he and his brother would be left after we went. We did our will and each were assigned this and that. That was the expectation, that they could go on forever.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Jake and his wife moved to Alaska, and we went to visit often and saw our granddaughter. Then one day he called me and said, Mom I&rsquo;m having trouble just taking a deep breath. I said, can you describe it? He said it feels like I can take a breath just fine, but it&rsquo;s like my lungs aren&rsquo;t inflating all the way. That was his complaint. I said, you need to go in. They treated him for an infection in Alaska, but things just started to go down. Then they realized he was <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/rejection\">rejecting</a>. It was acute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was airlifted down here to Washington, and was in the hospital for a while. They tried many therapies to try to stop the rejection process. We brought him home, and we knew that this wasn&rsquo;t good. I guess I was in fight mode, and denial mode. His wife asked me, what happens if he doesn&rsquo;t make it through this? And I said, I am not allowing myself to think that. We&rsquo;re going to keep doing everything we need to do. We tried every therapy, everything we could to do get him at least back up to where he could qualify for possibly another transplant. We got a belly tube put in, so we were feeding him 24 hours. He took all of his medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Things went very, very fast. Just months. He was really struggling. He knew. I stayed home from work; his brother stayed with him a lot. The day he passed away he got up and I told him I could help him get up from bed. But after he went back to bed he didn&rsquo;t wake up. I panicked. It was fast, and very difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t get any easier, but you learn to cope a little bit. His brother seemed lost for a while. They had fun together throughout their lives. I feel for him when I think about it, knowing that he too would go through lung transplant. Derek suffered, I could tell from his behavior. I know sometimes he was depressed. We talked about getting back to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Derek&rsquo;s health started to decline further, we moved him to a mobile home on our property that we&rsquo;d fixed up. He was close by, but could have his life. The requirements had changed for lung transplant for him. Eligibility and selection were different. We were prepared in some ways, because we knew what was coming since we&rsquo;d been through it before. At the transplant class we were able to learn&nbsp;a bit more. We knew transplant was it, that it was what we had to do and we had hopes. Again, we had the attitude that he should outlive us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Derek got his lung transplant when he was less advanced in his disease, not like his brother. He didn&rsquo;t think he was as sick as he needed to be. He said when he got the call, he was like, &ldquo;are you sure?&rdquo; I was in a meeting when he called me. He made a joke about going to dinner in Seattle that night. It dawned on me what he was doing, that we were getting lungs, and off we went. I think we were a little bit more prepared, obviously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a surprise; how quick it went. We were prepared to wait. It just went super-fast, but this time up instead of downhill. When the lungs came, it was like, oh my gosh that was amazingly quick. It was like, he&rsquo;s doing this already, you&rsquo;re kidding. He wasn&rsquo;t apprehensive, just a little nervous. We&rsquo;d had talked about <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/chest-tubes\">chest tubes</a> and how he was going to have more of them. He knew they were not that painful, because there&rsquo;s not that many nerve receptors there. He had chest tubes when he had a spontaneous pneumothorax. &nbsp;We&rsquo;d talk about stuff like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It just was so different. Jake had been scared of needles. He had a litany of things going on. He talked about letting go, not wanting any heroics. Two different kids completely, but both tremendous individuals. With Derek, the conversation was different. If his lungs started to fail he&rsquo;d want to fight. If we ever saw signs of rejection, we wouldn&rsquo;t mess around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He&rsquo;s gaining weight and doing all these things &ndash; he was playing football with some of the little kids the other day, and it&rsquo;s just so fun to watch again. He can do these things again.</p>",

I would encourage people to have a conversation with their loved one about <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/advance-care-planning\">their wishes</a>. Jake was very pragmatic about&nbsp;these types of conversations. With Derek, we could broach the subject and nothing would be off limits. He knows about our will. These are things to talk about. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a conversation to be afraid of. Having it ahead of time and knowing, is a good thing. Right now, he is doing so well. But there can be false hope that&nbsp;happens when they get very sick. You can&rsquo;t just know. We had to go through this conversation with Jake, and there was stuff he just didn&rsquo;t want. It was a hard reality for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know things happen and are beyond our control. I would advise people not to worry. It&rsquo;s like paying interest on something you&rsquo;ll never own. You won&rsquo;t enjoy life, you won&rsquo;t enjoy your children. When my kids were little I worried all the time about them leaving me and what I would do. It can be horrible. What if, what if, all the time. I was being a caregiver more than a mom. You can question and learn all you can, but you can also have faith. Ultimately you have to let go. Do the things that you know you need to do and enjoy what you have. Concentrate on what you have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the seven-year mark I might start watching Derek like a hawk. I watch him now. I&rsquo;m not na&iuml;ve. I always check and see how he&rsquo;s doing, but we don&rsquo;t want to talk about something going wrong constantly. I just want to hear from him, but I don&rsquo;t want either of us to spend our lives worrying. He&rsquo;s got a whole new lease on life and he should run with it. We&rsquo;re going to go 110%-- whatever years we can get out of it. I have confidence, things are good, and his team is fantastic. I know that they&rsquo;re watching him, I know he&rsquo;s doing everything he&rsquo;s supposed to do. We look at it like a gift--it is one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doctors were going to try some of the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/trikafta\">new therapies</a> with him before he got the call. We appreciate what we&rsquo;ve got, although there are no guarantees. It is great if the new medications work for other people and it would be nice to know that. But honestly, I didn&rsquo;t look at those because it turned out to not matter for us. If there is something we can try in the future to augment what he does now, we will learn more. If he got into trouble with <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/rejection\">rejection</a> we would change our tactics. The CF Foundation has worked very hard, and there is a lot of research that could help people hold out without getting a transplant. We would celebrate alongside those people and be happy for their successes.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I was surprised to be told I could get a lung transplant, and I questioned whether I&rsquo;d get to transplant and be told I&rsquo;m not ready, then have to go through another evaluation to get to that point later. I didn&rsquo;t realize that 35% lung function was low enough to be referred. I guess my CF doctor brought it up because of my need for so many IV antibiotics in one year. At first, they didn&rsquo;t cover a lot of the specifics. They knew that I would ask enough questions if I needed to. But I liked how they just looked at me and said &ldquo;so how do you feel about transplant? I was thinking about referring you, how would you feel about that?&rdquo; Obviously, that seemed like the right approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I had my first appointment with the transplant team I had to cancel because I couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of going through <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/tests\">tests</a> at the hospital after what had happened during my last stay. I talked to a psychologist, and three or four months later started again. It took a fair amount of courage to finally do it, considering how long I&rsquo;ll be in-patient after surgery. But the transplant team was very helpful. They were so good with my family members and answered their questions in an organized way and it wasn&rsquo;t too long of a day for us. My partner didn&rsquo;t have any idea what he was supposed to do or not do after a transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past when I thought of transplant, I was apprehensive. I thought about what my family members would go through, more than me. I think the worst risk is to put my family through all of this, have them take all the time off and get into the mindset that I&rsquo;ve going to live, and then possibly I don&rsquo;t even live through the surgery, or I get rejection and then they are stuck in the <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/caregiver\">caregiver</a> role. The point of transplant, I believe, is to get not only yourself, but those around you, a little more freedom. I&rsquo;m worried that it&rsquo;ll just end up shackling them more to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also wondered if I wanted to be kept <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/survival-statistics\">alive that long</a> with so many things wrong in my body, as if I was an experiment. I feel in the first generation to live this long. No one told me as a kid that I was going to live as long as I was. I thought I would die mid-20s. What if things are going too far? I wasn&rsquo;t sure if all the doctors that see me were on the same page. What about how my kidneys would do? Honestly, my lungs and my heart seem better than the rest of me. Which isn&rsquo;t saying much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve known of people through Facebook who I&rsquo;ve talked to about lung transplant. It seems like a highly variable, person by person process of what&rsquo;s going to go wrong, and no one really has any idea until it happens. Which is the most frightening thing about it, because I have a little OCD about being ahead of the curve, so I can avoid things before they happen. And to have to put my trust in people that I haven&rsquo;t really met yet is scary. But I&rsquo;m amazed that some people last 15 years, or have less years but they say the years are great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I honestly haven&rsquo;t talked too much with my doctors about treatment decisions. I know when to ask for IV <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/antibiotics\">antibiotics</a>, and we talk about if I need my pills upgraded to a stronger dose. I always have concerns about IV antibiotics because they&rsquo;ve given me kidney problems and I&rsquo;m at the point of needing a kidney transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just had my fourth sinus surgery. We also had to focus on controlling my diabetes. Mine is really hard to control, and I was trying to work with my <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/diabetes\">diabetes</a> doctors to get a pump and a <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/dexcom-g6\">Dexcom</a> continuous glucose monitor (CGM), but being on Medicaid, they said there was no way to get either. I waited for ten years, and until I finally got fed up and I just called the makers of pumps and CGMs, and three months later I had both. It was kind of heartbreaking. I&rsquo;m also using an app called Android APS (Artificial Pancreas System), and it got my A1C down from 9 to 5.7. When you&rsquo;re a Medicaid patient you have to fight to be given the best medications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had a hospitalization earlier this year for ten days and things went horribly wrong. It&rsquo;s scary as hell to be admitted to the hospital, especially if you don&rsquo;t have someone with you like a family member at all times. It&rsquo;s hard to ask your family members to live in the hospital. I think it really depends on the luck of the draw what doctor you have, how well they know the ins and outs of Medicaid, and how well they go to bat for you. The staff can be dismissive, and there is always a new doctor. No one ever tells you the doctor&rsquo;s name. It&rsquo;s always a frightening experience.</p>",

        "title": "Trikafta's Role",
        "content": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">My <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/lung-function\">lung function</a> went from 35% to 45% of predicted as I was going through the transplant process taking <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/symdeko\">Symdeko</a> (tezacaftor/ivacaftor). I tried not to think about how things would be after a lung transplant, because I don&rsquo;t want to jinx things. I didn&rsquo;t want to focus on what wasn&rsquo;t guaranteed to happen. And I came to feel that I was too healthy for transplant. I certainly didn&rsquo;t want to get one before I needed one when I can wait until I actually need it. I wasn&rsquo;t even on oxygen. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Eight months ago, I was prescribed <a href=\"https://take-on-transplant.herokuapp.com/resources/trikafta\">Trikafta</a>&nbsp;</span>(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor).<span style=\"color:black\">&nbsp;The approval was quite easy, it was surprising. I had maybe one more meeting before they were going to decide to list me for a lung transplant. Within a few weeks I had gained almost 20 percent lung function. It wasn&rsquo;t even my decision, they just took me off the transplant list. They couldn&rsquo;t justify it. My lung function got up to 57% with only a month and a half of the medication. It was quite a shock actually. That was the main emotion. As far as I can tell the doctors aren&rsquo;t really sure what to think about it and I&rsquo;ve only had two appointments by video call during the time I&rsquo;ve been on it. They probably aren&rsquo;t sure if it is going to last and I&rsquo;m not sure it was going to last, but it has for eight months. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d handle getting worse, but I&rsquo;m also not sure I could handle getting any better.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">I have energy. I&rsquo;ve painted one door five times for something to do, although in part that&rsquo;s probably from boredom due to the pandemic. Each day I cough maybe five times- that&rsquo;s it in comparison to every other second previously. I haven&rsquo;t had one dose of IVs since going on Trikafta. I haven&rsquo;t had to go to the ER even once. I didn&rsquo;t have any memory of feeling this good. It&rsquo;s good timing because if you cough outside right now with the pandemic, people don&rsquo;t like you, which makes sense. It was amazing. I feel better now than I did 15 years ago. Pretty much everything is different. It&rsquo;s overwhelmingly bizarre. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine not coughing up green phlegm every day. Now when I blow my nose it&rsquo;s clear. It&rsquo;s not horrifying like when I was sick. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">It&rsquo;s been a weird adjustment to spend the better part of a decade thinking you are going to die and then need to prepare that you can live 15-20 more years. It is quite a change to wake up- mentally and physically and realize you haven&rsquo;t lived your life. I don&rsquo;t have much work experience, and even if I want to work I can&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;m on social security and I need to keep it for the medication. I&rsquo;m alive, and now I look around and realize I am so stuck. What do I do with this health if I can&rsquo;t work? I know I&rsquo;m supposed to be really happy, but I&rsquo;m not in my early twenties. I don&rsquo;t have time to go to school and create a career trajectory. If I went to school I&rsquo;d be looking for someone to hire me at 42. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">When I was last healthy enough to work I lost a big portion of my SSI for about a year because of the percentage they took out for every dollar I earned. Then I lost my job because I got sick and couldn&rsquo;t get healthy enough again to work, and it took four months to get my SSI re-instated. Luckily, I still had my insurance. Right now, I&rsquo;m aware that if I worked I would only have so many months before they cut my checks and I lost my insurance. Damned if you do damned if you don&rsquo;t. I do have a job interview coming up. I feel like I have to do something, I&rsquo;m losing my mind. As a woman you feel like you should be contributing to the household now that you&rsquo;re healthy enough to do so. I&rsquo;ve been trying to live on $420 of SSI a month and I&rsquo;m not doing so great at that. And I need to be able to pay my rent and my bills, but if I lose my insurance I&rsquo;m in trouble. I have many many more medications than Trikafta that I have to have. I&rsquo;ve had CF so long there are so many things that have gone wrong. How could I depend on insurance from a business that is small and ask them to cover Trikafta and eight other medications? </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">I&rsquo;ve had some side effects from the Trikafta. In the beginning I lost half of my hair. But I guess my body has adjusted to whatever it was going through. My hair is growing back in every direction and is about three and a half inches long. My attention span seems about two seconds long in comparison to what it used to be. It is as if I&rsquo;m in the only generation that is in this in-between phase. We&rsquo;re like the last people with polio. But you do the best you can because that&rsquo;s all you can do. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">People on Facebook and forums are all talking about Trikafta 24/7. It seems like I&rsquo;m having similar issues from what I read. It&rsquo;s hard to keep a handle on your emotions, but maybe that is because those of us on it aren&rsquo;t used to being fully alive and it takes a while to get back to what other people feel all of the time. Emotions are magnified enormously. I think it has to do with having a new lease on life but without a real future. We have a lot of things in our lives we didn&rsquo;t get a chance to examine before because everything was an emergency.&nbsp; There is a guilt factor where you don&rsquo;t want to feel anger or depressed because look where you are now. You don&rsquo;t want to tell your doctor that you are dissatisfied with getting to live longer. But it would be nice to have a regular job and get used to living with a schedule and have things to get up for in the morning that matter. That would make a world of difference. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve stopped having frequent exacerbations on Trikafta, and my&nbsp;lung transplant referral was closed.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>I was getting IV antibiotics about once a month. I was run down, low energy and motivation, and just getting through. The day I got the call I had reached out to my nurse in the morning because I&#39;d coughed up blood the night before, which was common for me. I thought, thank god!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;I was definitely surprised, because it had been two and a half years.&nbsp;I was like, oh, wow. I was pretty calm. I was surprised and relieved,&nbsp;I was&nbsp;excited, and I felt pretty peaceful. I had just been thinking about how I needed to get more organized for transplant! The call came in at 2:30 in the afternoon after I&#39;d eaten and was just hanging out. It was a good timeline, not a horrible rush. I had time to absorb it and talk to people, which was nice. We had a few hours to get ready to go to the hospital. I started calling people and letting them know. They told me to come in at 8pm at night and that if everything was a go, my surgery would be at 10am the next morning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They knocked me out after a couple of minutes of getting in the OR. They said okay are you ready and I said I guess. See you on the other side. Then I woke up five days later.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t remember anything, the surgery or the&nbsp;five days that I was out. The surgery was 15 and a half hours I think?&nbsp;I just remember going in, then I remember waking up. I was told it went really well, no complications, just&nbsp;a vein they had to manuever when they were doing my liver.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mouth was drier than it had ever been when I woke up.&nbsp;&nbsp;It felt like a desert. I woke up with the ventilator and the tube in my mouth. But I was really, really frustrated immediately. Get this thing out of my mouth, I need some water. I couldn&rsquo;t communicate well because one, I had something in my mouth, and two, my mouth was so dry. And they kept asking, what do you want? I was so, so frustrated, beyond frustrated. My husband wasn&rsquo;t understanding me, I was trying to sign letters to him. He&rsquo;s like, what, huh? Nobody was getting me. Finally after 20 minutes I got across that I&rsquo;m thirsty, I need water. They said you can&rsquo;t have it because you&rsquo;ll aspirate. I was so mad. They said, your breathing isn&rsquo;t quite there yet. You&rsquo;re at 10 and you need to have 20 breaths per minute or something like that.&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know how to get it there. I couldn&#39;t even think I was so thirsty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They took everything out and said, ok this is your first breath. It felt weird. The nurses were all really great, but they wanted to do a bunch of things when they came in before I could have water or ice chips. My pain the first two nights was really rough. It took awhile to get my pain meds under control, but once that was resolved I was more comfortable and things got better.&nbsp;</p>",

I was still on precautions, so I couldn&rsquo;t use my arms. A lot of things that I wanted to do I couldn&rsquo;t do, either because I didn&rsquo;t have the energy or I didn&rsquo;t have the ability. My days were usually pretty packed with breathing treatments, and PT, and doctors &ndash; I had four teams that would come see me each day.&nbsp;During my down time, I slept. That&rsquo;s all I wanted. But it did get long towards the end, and I just wanted to go home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was nice to be home with my husband, because I couldn&#39;t have visitors for awhile in the hospital because of COVID restrictions.&nbsp;It was definitely a challenge to figure out the meds, and&nbsp;the new schedule. Make sure that I was eating enough. My husband was having to juggle a lot on his end, with the house and the cooking. I think we were both surprised at how hard it was. It was definitely challenging that first couple of weeks. It did get easier, every day was a little bit easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first it was weird how my diaphragm muscles weren&#39;t there anymore from the surgery. I had gurgles and crackling in my lungs, from the surgery and all the fluid. With CF, you know you have to clear it, but I realized it was fine for things to work themselves out. There were clues, like being ok sleeping in one position on my back. I didn&#39;t feel that different, but I wasn&#39;t coughing. My lungs weren&#39;t fully expanded, until one day when it felt amazing to breathe. I started to have moments of wow, this is going to be really good. There were certain times&nbsp;when&nbsp;my lungs would start&nbsp;to relax. With pure breath, there was no pain or discomfort. Then there were times I was still in pain or out of breath. I was better, but still with the energy and weakness levels of pre-transplant. Working on getting in shape, strong, and building my muscles became important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s nice getting PFTs now and seeing the numbers go up (85% of predicted) instead of down. I have limitations, but I can get there. Walking is important. Trying to do what you can. Having goals about&nbsp;doing what you want to do.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m definitely looking forward to just being able to expand my physical abilities. Recreationally go on hikes, or biking with my husband. Over the years your world gets small.&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>On the one hand, I&rsquo;m glad it took as long as it did. I did feel like I was ready about a year after I was on the list waiting. But I also can look back and see all these different phases. Accepting and getting my head around transplant. I definitely had a lot of anxiety starting the process. Then feeling like I needed&nbsp;to make all these lists, and get things together. Then I&rsquo;d fizzle out!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to address your anxiety and worry, find ways to address how you feel. It is legit. Take steps to worry less, to be present.&nbsp;By the time I got the call, I had already worked through all of this&nbsp;grasping for control, and I was like, it&rsquo;s going to be fine. Whatever happens, no problem. I was so peaceful and the whole process really was very peaceful for me. I got excellent care. It ended up being a very positive experience for me. I think my internal state was calm and I was able to go with the flow a lot more, and just be more present, and also curious about it. And therefore, I think hopefully I was a lot more pleasant to deal with. There were low level discomforts and I needed work arounds because it was hard to be an advocate for myself. But it is important to push a bit.&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t forget to say please and thank you, make their job as easy as possible. Do not make them guess what you need and what you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d say on the emotional, mental, and spiritual level, you have to decide how you&rsquo;re going to go into the waiting. What other things can you focus on that have to do with personal growth, or using the time to prepare. This is your time to reckon with a lot of those harder questions. Who you are, and why you want to do this, and what you are living for, and what brings you joy. Especially if you have a longer waiting time, you start to realize that time is really invaluable. You could spend all of your time waiting with bated breath, but that&rsquo;s exhausting. And it starts to put you into this boundary that doesn&rsquo;t need to exist. Like you can&rsquo;t say yes to anything, or you can&rsquo;t start big projects because you&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;ll get interrupted, and then you&rsquo;d be unreliable, then people would think bad of you. And it&rsquo;s just not true, especially if you&rsquo;re out front saying, just know I could get called at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that I said to myself over and over, it&rsquo;s going to happen when it&rsquo;s supposed to happen. I chose that I was going to believe that, and not be anxious about it not happening. It will happen when it&rsquo;s supposed to happen, and that&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:48px\">&nbsp;</p>",

While lung transplant is not the right treatment option for all individuals with CF, the discussion is important for everyone. Annual discussion of lung transplant is recommended in CF Clinic for individuals with CF once their lung function reaches an FEV1 less than 50% of predicted. Planning for transplant involves understanding the stage of your CF (e.g. how sick your lungs are), the transplant referral process, possible barriers to transplant, and how to strengthen your health prior to transplant. It is important to consider the cost of lung transplant and your particular insurance requirements. A good support system contributes to having a successful transplant. Awareness about post-transplant outcomes is also part of planning for transplant and can help with expectations and processing your experiences after lung transplant. Connecting with individuals with CF who have had a lung transplant can be very helpful. Working together with your CF care team is important throughout the transplant journey. Ask your CF doctor when you have questions about lung transplant.</p>"

        "content": "<p>Many factors contribute to the financial cost of lung transplant. There are costs while being evaluated, while waiting for transplant, during the transplant hospitalization, for housing near the transplant center before and/or after transplant, and long-term after transplant. It is also important to consider the potential for disability/lost wages before or while recovering from transplant, which can also affect caregivers who may need to help with your care for a period. Some costs may be covered by health insurance, while others require out-of-pocket payments. The choice of health insurance is always important for individuals with chronic health conditions like CF, but even more important when a person with CF is nearing lung transplant. The CF Foundation&rsquo;s Compass program is a one-on-one service available to help individuals with CF and their family members navigate insurance, financial, or legal issues. Your CF Center&rsquo;s social worker and/or lung transplant program&rsquo;s social worker can provide guidance about saving money for transplant-related expenses and fundraising. Requirements for the amount of savings or financial resources varies from transplant center to transplant center. One CF lung transplant recipient put it best, &ldquo;I&#39;ve seen a number of patients who were not listed because they, for lack of a better way of putting it, failed the financial test. That&#39;s a terrible reason to be denied being listed. But I guess if there&rsquo;s a way &ndash; if you&rsquo;re going to be talking to people ten years before transplant might be a necessity for them &ndash; and if you could somehow suggest that they start a piggy bank or something, that would not be a terrible idea. That&#39;s only one tiny aspect of preparing oneself for transplant, but like I said it&rsquo;s pretty awful if that&rsquo;s the only thing that keeps you from being listed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read More (cost):</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testing during the evaluation, appointments with doctors/nutritionist/social worker, and procedures to address problems discovered during the evaluation may all come with co-pays or out-of-pocket costs. Depending on your insurance coverage, some tests may need to be performed at preferred or &ldquo;in network&rdquo; sites rather than at the lung transplant center. Understanding the requirements for your insurance policy will be necessary so you can&nbsp; avoid surprise costs during the evaluation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insurance policies may also dictate which lung transplant programs are available to you for your transplant. If you are turned down for transplant at the insurance company&rsquo;s preferred transplant program, it is typically possible to appeal for coverage at an alternative transplant center. This is especially relevant for CF patients with difficult to treat infections (e.g. Burkholderia cenocepacia) or conditions that make their transplant more challenging (e.g. the need for a combined organ transplant like lung-liver transplant).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need to relocate before (while waiting) and/or after lung transplant, there are sometimes insurance benefits to cover housing. Different transplant centers have differing requirements for how close to the hospital you need to remain while listed and after transplant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cff.org/Assistance-Services/About-Compass/What-Is-Compass/\">CF Foundation: Compass</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children&rsquo;s Organ Transplant Association (COTA), serving adults as well as children, is an organization that has a history of helping CF patients fundraise for lung transplant.

The CF Foundation recommends referring children who have low FEV1 sooner (at a higher level of FEV1 % of predicted)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How quickly your lung function is decreasing is also a factor in the decision to refer. If you experience a 20% decrease in your FEV1 % of predicted over the course of 1 year, that is a sign that your CF is worsening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Everyone with an FEV1 less than 30% of predicted should be referred for lung transplant.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adults with FEV1 between 30% and 40% of predicted should be checked for other signs of worsening CF. For people with lung function in this range, there are certain factors that can prompt referral to a transplant center for consideration of lung transplant (see Signs that CF is Worsening below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of CFTR modulators (e.g. elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) can lead to large improvements in lung function, nutritional status, and other aspects of CF. How long CFTR modulators can delay lung transplant for people with CF is still unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Distance from the transplant center may be a factor in the timing of referral because it may be more difficult and time consuming to complete an evaluation in that setting. It is important to understand whether you will need to move to a new city for lung transplant, since that may take months or years of planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Younger women should be referred early. There is a &ldquo;gender gap&rdquo; in survival for people living with CF - women are at an increased risk of dying without lung transplant compared to men. There is no difference in post-lung transplant survival between women and men with CF. Women who have CF-related diabetes, rapidly decreasing BMI, or rapidly decreasing FEV1 are considered the highest risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For individuals who are shorter (height under 162 cm or 5 feet 4 inches), there is an increased risk of dying without transplant. The risk is partly explained because it is more difficult to find lung donors with lungs that are the correct size (see Transplant Operation below). Waiting times are longer for people who are shorter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain types of infections can limit which transplant centers will consider you for a lung transplant (see Contraindications/Modifiable Barriers below). Early referral allows time to determine whether your local transplant center considers a specific infection an absolute barrier to transplant and if you will need to approach other transplant centers (which can be time consuming and expensive if you need to travel).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have liver or kidney disease and may need multiple organs transplanted, early referral is recommended because not all transplant centers perform multi-organ transplants (more than just the lungs at one time) and waiting times can be longer when multiple organs are needed for one recipient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to recognize that referral does not necessarily prompt a full evaluation or listing, but instead gives individuals with CF, their families, and providers access to the expertise of the transplant team and the opportunity to fully consider lung transplant as a treatment option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

        "content": "<p><span style=\"color:black\">When you are referred, the transplant team will try to figure out how much transplant could help you (the possible &ldquo;benefits&rdquo;), as well as how risky transplant may be for you. This is called &ldquo;weighing the benefits and risks&rdquo;, and will start with the team reading information in your medical chart, discussions with your CF team, and/or an in-person visit. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">To figure out how much transplant could help you (the benefits), the transplant team will review how sick you are right now: How you feel, whether you are getting worse, how often you are in the hospital or needing antibiotics, your lung function, and other problems or test results to understand your quality of life and chance of dying from your CF lung disease. The transplant team will usually wait to put you onto the waiting list until they feel that your chance of dying is high within the next two years. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The transplant team will also want to make sure that transplant isn&rsquo;t too risky. There are risks for any person, but some people may have conditions or problems that reduce the chance of transplant going well (make it riskier). These can be thought of as &ldquo;barriers&rdquo; or &ldquo;contraindications&rdquo; to transplant, and may prevent a person from being eligible.

Improvements can help with your chance of success with transplant and at the same time help you feel better before transplant. It is important to discuss strategies with your CF team as soon as possible. Sometimes, a transplant program will set goals or specific requirements that you will need to meet before you will be placed on the waiting list. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">It may be impossible to change some of these barriers (contraindications), and how this is handled can vary based on the specific situation and transplant program. For example, having <em>Mycobacterium abscessus</em> in the sputum may prevent a person with CF from being eligible for transplant at some, but not all, transplant centers. Contraindications are best discussed between you, your CF team, and the transplant team as early as possible. Sometimes, your CF team can also contact a different transplant center with more experience handling the specific issue(s). </span></p>"

They will let you know whether you are listed, or whether you need to finish any additional steps to help decide whether transplant is the right decision for you at this time. Sometimes, especially if your CF lung disease has been stable, they may want to see you back in clinic at least once before listing you.&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">After you&rsquo;ve been listed, waiting times for transplant vary based on how sick you are, your transplant program, your height/size, your blood type, and whether you have antibodies in the blood that could make you ineligible for some donor lungs. Across the U.S., in 2018 half of listed people waited less than 2.5 months for lungs, and half waited longer than 2.5 months, but this number varies a lot based on the transplant program and the other factors above. How sick you are is measured by the &ldquo;lung allocation score (LAS)&rdquo;, which is calculated based on your test results including lung function, oxygen requirement, blood tests, etc. The U.S. system&rsquo;s goal is to transplant the sickest patients (with the highest LAS) first. Across the U.S., about 10-20% of people on the waiting list die before receiving a transplant or become too sick and are removed from the list. As people get sicker from their lung disease, their LAS should increase to help improve their chance of getting lungs more quickly. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">While listed, you will follow up with your transplant center at least every 3 months. If you are very sick they may ask you to come more frequently. They will update tests and your LAS regularly. It is important to continue regular follow ups and communicate closely with your CF and transplant teams, especially if you feel like you are getting sicker or for other changes in your health. It is also important while listed to continue working on any modifiable barriers to transplant that you may have (see table above) including nutrition, physical conditioning, diabetes, etc. This will help improve your health while listed, help improve your chance of success with transplant, and make sure you remain a good candidate for transplant. </span></p>"
