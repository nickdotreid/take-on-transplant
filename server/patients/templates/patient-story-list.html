    <h1>Patient Stories</h1>
    <p class="large">Explore stories from people living with cystic fibrosis (CF) as they share their experiences with lung transplant. In the stories, they share their journeys from pre-transplant to life after transplant, and they give advice to others living with CF. Stories may include good outcomes or challenges they have faced to help educate those who may be considering lung transplant as a treatment option now or in the future. There are also stories to provide different perspectives, including caregivers for people with CF who went through transplant and individuals who felt better after starting elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta) and deferred transplant.</p>
