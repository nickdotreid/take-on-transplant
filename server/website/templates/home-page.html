        <p class="large">
            Take on Transplant is a website developed in collaboration with people living with cystic fibrosis (CF). We developed this website to help people feel empowered for conversations and decisions about lung transplant. This website couples real-life CF patient experiences of lung transplant in their own words (‘CF Stories’) with up-to-date, CF-specific medical information about lung transplant.

        <p>You have advanced lung disease with markers of increased disease severity based on your low FEV1 and frequent CF exacerbations that required IV antibiotics. The use of Trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) may delay the need for lung transplant, but people with advanced lung disease are likely to benefit from lung transplant at some time in the future.  It is important to continue to talk with your doctor about lung transplant. You may want to connect with patients who have been through the lung transplant journey. </p>
    
        <p>
            We recommend beginning your Take on Transplant journey with the following stories:
            {% for patient in patients %}
            {% if forloop.last %} and {% endif %}
            <a href="{% url 'patient-story' patient.id %}">{{patient.name}}{% if forloop.last %}.{% else %},{% endif %}</a>
            {% endfor %}
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also read more in the Resource Library:
            {% for resource in resources %}
            {% if forloop.last %} and {% endif %}
            <a href="{% url 'resource-article' resource.id %}">{{resource.title}}{% if forloop.last %}.{% else %},{% endif %}</a>
            {% endfor %}

    <p><a href="{% url 'patient-story-list' %}">Patient Stories:</a> Explore stories from people living with cystic fibrosis (CF) as they share their experiences with lung transplant. In the stories, they share their journeys from pre-transplant to life after transplant, and they give advice to others living with CF. Stories may include good outcomes or challenges they have faced to help educate those who may be considering lung transplant as a treatment option now or in the future. There are also stories to provide different perspectives, including caregivers for people with CF who went through transplant and individuals who felt better after starting elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta) and deferred transplant.</p>
    <p><a href="{% url 'resource-list' %}">Resource Library:</a> Find medical information, facts, and helpful resources as you consider lung transplant for yourself or as a caregiver. Topics include: Planning for transplant; caregiver information; transplant referral (including signs that your CF is worsening); eligibility, evaluation, and listing; the transplant surgery; surviving and thriving after transplant; and much more. This resource can help prepare you for conversations with your CF doctor, your caregivers, and your family/friends.</p>
    <p><a href="{% url 'question-list' %}">Frequently Asked Questions:</a> Read questions about lung transplant and answers provided by people with CF who have undergone lung transplant, in their own words. These questions are the most frequent ones they hear or the ones they asked when they went through the process. There are also responses from transplant doctors for questions about medical information.</p>
