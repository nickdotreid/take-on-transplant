            Explore stories from people living with cystic fibrosis (CF) as they share
            their experiences with lung transplant. In the stories, they share their journeys from pre-transplant to life after 
            transplant, and they give advice to others living with CF.

        <p>Stories may include good outcomes or challenges they have faced to help educate those who 
            may be considering lung transplant as a treatment option now or in the future.

        <p>
            There are also stories to provide different perspectives, including caregivers for 
            people with CF who went through transplant and individuals who felt better after 
            starting elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Trikafta) and deferred transplant.
